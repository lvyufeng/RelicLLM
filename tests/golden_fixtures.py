"""The served-path golden fixtures: one real request through one real entry point.

A fixture is a claim that a checkpoint still produces a known answer through a known entry point.
It is the only end-to-end claim this suite makes, and the reason it exists is that everything else
in `tests/` tests a piece: a kernel against a reference, a parser against a fixture, a boundary
against the source tree. A refactor of the request lifecycle can keep every one of those green and
still hand a client different tokens.

What is recorded, and why each field is there, is documented in `tests/README.md`. Two decisions
worth repeating here because they shape the code:

- **The command line is recorded, and the Python entries are driven through the CLI parser.** The
  fixture's `argv` goes through `relicllm.cli.build_parser()` -> `_args()` -> `EngineArgs`, so a
  fixture pins the flag plumbing as well as the model: a flag that stops being read, or a default
  that moves, changes the tokens this test produces. Driving `EngineArgs` directly would leave the
  layer between the operator and the engine untested, which is the layer a serving refactor is
  about.
- **The run is skipped, not failed, when the checkpoint is absent.** A fixture names a path on a
  machine that may not be this one. `pytest.skip` with the missing path is the honest outcome; the
  `test_every_entry_point_has_a_fixture` test in `test_served_path_golden.py` is what keeps the
  *set of recorded fixtures* complete, and it needs no weights at all.

Every entry point is a Python one: the C++ binary's own HTTP front end was removed, and the `cpp`
entry point now goes through `relicllm serve` like the rest. A fixture carries whichever answer its
entry can produce -- token ids exactly, text at least -- and the test compares what is there.

**One entry point is one process**, which is why `run_isolated` spawns a child rather than calling
`run` here. Five engines in one interpreter is a configuration nothing else in this repository uses,
and the failures it produces are not about the fixtures; the docstring on `run_isolated` records the
two that were observed and why they pass alone.
