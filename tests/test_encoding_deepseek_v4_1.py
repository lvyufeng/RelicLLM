"""Reading a V4.1 completion back: the tool-call cut, and the facts about the checkpoint behind it.

The adapter in :mod:`relicllm.backends.v41_backend` streams a *text*, and the format's tool-call
block is text too -- V4.1 wraps it in ``<｜DSML｜ calls>``, whose ``｜`` is a fullwidth vertical line
and not the ASCII character a reader expects, so the block is tokenized as ordinary text and reaches
a client that is being sent the running decode. :func:`cut_tool_calls` is what stops the answer where
the checkpoint's own parser stops reading its content, and the second half of this file pins the
facts about the released checkpoint that the cut is written against -- that the marker is the
encoder's own start token, that the block is plain text rather than special tokens, and that the
checkpoint's parser reads it into a call with no ``id``.

Those three are properties of the checkpoint rather than of this package, and none of them can be
had without the checkpoint: they are skipped when it is not on the host, with
``DEEPSEEK_V41_CHECKPOINT`` naming where it is. Read as a whole they are the argument for the
streaming code in ``v41_backend``: the cut is text, but the call is not -- it needs the
end-of-sentence token a client is never shown -- so the call travels on the last event, out of the
loop's own finished tokens.
