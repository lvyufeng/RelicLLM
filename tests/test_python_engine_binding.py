"""A Python object driven by the real C++ `BatchScheduler`.

The scheduler is one library with two kinds of host: the native binary, and whatever a Python
process hands it. This file is about the second kind, and it is the only place the trampoline is
exercised against the scheduler itself rather than against a fake of it -- a fake native module
cannot show that the GIL handoff and the by-value struct conversion work, because it is the
handoff and the conversion that are being tested.

The engine here does no model work. It answers every prompt with one fixed token and every decode
step with another, which is enough for the scheduler's own contract: it has to be handed one result
row and one completion flag per request, a token per decode step, and a `seq_len` that says how far
the prompt got.
