"""The Torch adapter reaches the same `BatchScheduler` the `cpp` backend drives.

`--backend torch` is what serves every checkpoint the four specific adapters do not claim, so this
is the last request lifecycle outside the shared scheduler and these tests are about closing it.

The engine is scripted rather than loaded: what is under test is the route, and the two arms are
driven by the same fake runtime, so anything that differs between them is the path and not the
model. The scheduler itself is the real one -- a fake of it would show that this adapter calls
something, not that the something accepts a Python engine and drives it a token at a time.
