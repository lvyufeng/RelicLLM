"""What the fused decode attention is worth on the token, as a difference of two shipped paths.

`mimo_decode_attention` is the only kernel in the MiMo path that is not bit-exact, and what it
buys is host time: `probe_mimo_v2_attention_path.py` puts `scores` + `softmax` + `out` + `view` at
19.1 ms of a token's host at sixteen resident rows, which is eighteen eager dispatches a layer. The
arm below is the path this model took before the kernel existed -- `_decode_ops = None`, so
`decode_output` takes the torch block -- and the kernel arm minus it is the kernel's price.

**The two arms are not bit-identical**, which is the whole difficulty of reading this one, and the
probe is shaped around it. The kernel's float32 agrees with the torch block's to about 3e-7
relative, but the answer that leaves the layer is bfloat16, so a fraction of the elements land on
the other side of a rounding boundary and the arms' hidden states are not the same tensor. The
draws the router then takes are *usually* the same and can differ, and a differing draw changes how
much the step copies over PCIe -- which is 34 ms of the token on its own. So a price read off the
clock alone would be a price of "the kernel plus however many copies its last bits moved".

Three things in this probe are what make the number readable:

* **The chain is fixed**, derived once with the kernel shipped, and both arms replay the same
  tokens at the same positions. Neither arm samples, so the comparison is not about the sampler's
  luck.
* **The draws are compared, not assumed.** Each arm reports the resident hit rate and the number of
  experts staged, and a pair whose hit rates differ is a pair whose copies differ -- the line the
  probe prints between the arms is the confounder's size rather than a caveat.
* **The rounds are interleaved** `off, on, off, on, ...`, so the drift this box has between two
  runs of the same configuration lands on both arms, and the arms are timed in one process minutes
  apart rather than in two processes an afternoon apart.

The clock is split into the host's time -- the wall between the step's first dispatch and its last,
which is where a host-bound decode step spends the kernel's saving -- and the queue behind it.

Measured at sixteen resident rows on four ranks, one process, `--steps 8`: the **held** pair reads
**108.0 -> 91.9 ms a step** (9.26 to 10.88 tok/s) and **107.4 -> 92.9** (9.31 to 10.77) in two runs,
all of it on the host, with the queue unchanged at 4.5 ms. The **free** pair reads **-19.9** and
**-19.1 ms** in the same two runs -- bigger, and to be read as "the kernel plus the copies its last
bits moved", because the run whose counters are printed staged 996 experts with the torch block
against 853 with the kernel over its 32-step replay. The held pair agreeing to 1.6 ms across two
runs while the free pair ranged over ten is the reason the hold is there.

The same box, the same afternoon, `probe_mimo_v2_ablate.py --steps 10 --warmup 3 --rounds 4
--arms shipped` reads **125.8 ms a token over four rounds with a 110.4 to 141.3 spread**: an
absolute number on this host moves further across rounds than the kernel is worth, which is why
nothing above is quoted as a rate on its own.
