"""Is a restored prefix the state the same prefix would have built from scratch?

A prefix store is only sound if a *resume* is the same forward as a cold prefill cut at the same
place, and for this model that claim has two halves that are not the same kind of claim.

The first is exact and is about the *copy*: a snapshot carries a global layer's leading rows and a
windowed layer's whole ring, and putting them back has to reproduce those bytes and the layer's write
head. That is asserted with `torch.equal`, because a copy that is a rounding away from its source is
a bug and not a tolerance.

The second is not exact and the reason is worth writing down rather than hiding behind a loose
number: `tests/test_models_mimo_v2_device_attention.py::test_a_chunked_prefill_is_a_one_shot_prefill`
holds a chunked prefill to `atol=1e-4` against the one-shot, because the attention's gemms change
shape with a chunk and the float sums reassociate. A resume *is* a chunk boundary at the stored
length -- generally not a multiple of the chunk the cold path would have used -- so the tokens past
it get the continuation's chunking and not the one-shot's. The tests here therefore compare against a
cold prefill at a relative tolerance, and the claim they are pinning is that the state is right: a
wrong key, a wrong slot or a stale row moves the answer by orders more than the rearrangement does.
The test that separates the two is `test_the_tail_a_snapshot_does_not_carry_is_never_read`, which
poisons the rows a snapshot leaves behind and demands the continuation come out *bit-identical* --
the only way that can hold is if the tail was never read at all.

The other thing here is that the write head is state. A restore that put the buffers back and left
the head where the previous request stopped would answer a continuation out of a span the snapshot
never described, and the failure would look like a model bug several tokens later rather than like a
cache bug. `set_written` is the only writer and the snapshot carries it per layer.

The last section is the adapter: that the store is built, reported in `capabilities`, counted in
`/metrics`, and that a repeat's reuse reaches a client as `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`.
