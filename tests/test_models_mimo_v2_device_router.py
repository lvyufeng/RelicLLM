"""The C++ router against the reference it was transcribed from, to the bit.

`layers.gate_and_route` is the definition of MiMo-V2.6's router and `src/csrc/mimo_decode_ops.cpp`
is a transcription of it: the same ATen calls, in the same order, with the same defaults, reached
without a Python frame apiece. That is the entire claim the transcription makes -- it is not a
faster approximation of the router, it *is* the router -- and it is a claim a test can hold it to
exactly, because a path that runs the same kernels on the same arguments cannot have rounded
anything differently.

Why it is worth doing at all: a decode step routes forty-seven times and each routing is two dozen
small operations on one row. `tests/probe_mimo_v2_host_phases.py` puts the router at 23.5 ms of a
token's host time, which at these shapes is the cost of asking rather than of arithmetic.

The shapes below are the release's -- a 4096-wide hidden, 256 experts, the released grouping -- and
the rows are 1, 2 and 9 so that the decode row and a small batch are both covered. The values are
random, which is what makes the test about the arithmetic rather than about a checkpoint.
