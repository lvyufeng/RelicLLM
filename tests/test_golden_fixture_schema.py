"""The golden-fixture harness itself: the schema, the flag reader, the child protocol, the skip rule.

The end-to-end tests in `test_served_path_golden.py` all skip without a checkpoint, so without these
the harness would be code that runs nowhere on a machine with no weights -- which is most machines.
What they cover is the part that decides *what* an end-to-end run means: how a fixture is read and
written, how a child hands an outcome back, and when a fixture is skipped rather than run.

The skip rule is the one worth being explicit about, and it has exactly two reasons, both about the
machine rather than about the answer: the checkpoint is not here, and a resource the fixture states
it needs is not free. Both are asserted below so that nothing else can quietly join that list: a
fixture that skipped because its *answer* moved would be a regression wearing a skip.

The `card` a fixture records is deliberately *not* a third reason, and there is a test below that
holds it to being recorded-and-never-read: the field answers which silicon produced the answer, and
a fixture whose card differs from the one reading it has not moved its answer -- it was simply taken
somewhere else. Skipping on it would report that as an unrunnable host, which is a different claim.
