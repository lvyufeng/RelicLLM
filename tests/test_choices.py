"""One request, several choices: the fan-out both front ends share.

``n`` is a dispatch rule rather than a model rule -- an engine schedules one generation, so ``n``
choices are ``n`` generations -- and this module is where that rule is decided once. The seeds are
checked against a vector taken from the C++ front end's own ``derived_choice_seed``, compiled and
run for these values, because a seed that drifts from the one the front end pinned would change the
text of every choice in a request that named one.
