"""What a CUDA graph would buy Xing4.0's decode step, measured before it is built.

The stage-5 record leaves the decode step at 6.5 tok/s against a 152 tok/s byte
floor and attributes it to host submission: 178 ms of host against 46.5 ms of
device work in a 176 ms step.  That attribution is a *difference* between two
figures taken different ways, and the number that decides the next stage is not
the difference -- it is how much of the 178 ms a graph actually recovers.  This
probe is that number.

Three arms, one process, the same weights, interleaved A-B-A-B-A-A-C so drift
lands on every column:

    eager     the step as the server runs it, in a loop
    graph     the same forward captured at one frozen position and replayed
    compile   `torch.compile(mode="reduce-overhead")` around the same step

`graph` is deliberately not a decode loop.  Every replayed step is the same
position at the same token, which is what makes the capture legal before any of
the position-as-a-tensor work is done -- a Python `start_pos` is baked into the
capture, so the graph is only the same graph at every position once that work
exists.  It is the *upper bound*: it answers "how much of this step is launch
cost at all", and if the answer is small the rest of the plan is wrong.

What the capture needs is one thing, and it is not a model change: the token has
to arrive as a CUDA tensor.  `Xing4_0GGUFModel.embed` calls
`torch.as_tensor(input_ids, device=...)`, which is a pageable host-to-device copy
for a Python list and the identity for a tensor already on the card.  Nothing
else in the decode forward transfers or synchronises -- `generate.sample_token`'s
`.cpu()` is at the end of the step and stays outside this probe by construction.
