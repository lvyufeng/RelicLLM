"""The IQ4_NL raw-block GEMM against the format's own decoder.

``iq4_nl`` is the eleventh type in the raw-block runtime and the only one whose
block is 32 weights rather than 256.  ``src/csrc/cuda_kernel_impl.cu`` handles
that by folding: a kernel's 256-wide span is eight consecutive native blocks, so
``iq4nl_block_dot_256`` walks eight sub-blocks where the other ten formats unpack
one header, and no GEMM above it needed an IQ4_NL case.

What that buys is a small kernel and what it costs is a specific class of bug --
a geometry that is right for every other format and wrong for this one -- so the
tests here are aimed at the seams rather than at the arithmetic:

- the codebook and the nibble order, against ``loader/gguf/iq4_nl.py``;
- the decode kernel (one row) and the prefill kernel (four rows at a time),
  which take different code paths through the same dot;
- the grouped-MoE entry point, which is how this format is actually reached;
- a real tensor out of the released checkpoint, because a synthetic block can be
  uniform in ways the format is not.

Every comparison is against a fp32 reference computed from the decoded blocks,
so the tolerance is the kernel's accumulation order and not the format's error.
