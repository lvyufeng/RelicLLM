"""What a MiMo-V2.6 prompt costs when it goes through as chunks instead of a token at a time.

`bench_mimo_v2_model.py` measures a *prompt* by feeding it one token at a time, which is the only
shape the single-token expert kernel has, and `bench_mimo_v2_ep.py` measures the same loop with the
experts dealt out over four cards. Both of them report a prefill of a few tokens a second, and
neither of them is a prefill: a prompt fed a row at a time draws its experts a row at a time, so the
cost is the decode step's times the prompt's length.

This script measures the path that exists for the prompt. `prefill` feeds `--chunk` tokens a call
through `moe_multi_token_fp4_forward`, whose arena holds a rank's share of the layer's experts and
whose kernel groups the chunk's drawings by expert, so the bytes a layer moves are the experts a
*chunk* draws -- nearly all of a rank's share -- and the calls a layer makes are the bands that
share is computed in, not the tokens. The two rates are in the same table, on the same prompt and
the same weights, and the ratio between them is what the stage bought.

What the numbers are made of:

* `MiB/token` is the rank's own staging counter divided by the prompt. It falls as the chunk grows
  and stops falling when the chunk draws a rank's entire share, which is where a prefill stops
  being about the copy: the floor is `--band` rows of 12.75 MiB a layer, divided by the chunk.
* `copy ms/token` prices those bytes at the link rate this host actually sustains, so the copy's
  share of the token is a measurement of what the prefill would cost if the copy were all of it.
* `attn ms` and `mlp ms` are the same per-layer event pairs the other two benches use, and the
  split is the opposite of decode's: a chunk's attention is quadratic in its own length while its
  expert copy is spread over the chunk.

And the verification, which is why this is worth running with four ranks: the ranks must agree on
the prefill's last row bit for bit -- they hold the same sum -- and each rank's staged bytes must be
its own share.

`--deal` is the *step's* deal and not the chunk's, and it is the difference between this table and a
served run. A chunk can only go through a deal that partitions *experts* (`id`), so a model built
with `--deal sorted` -- which is what `relicllm serve` builds -- keeps two modules and routes the
chunks to the `id` one; the prefill rows are identical either way, and the `--decode` rows are not:
under `id` a step runs through the prefill's own module, which the step probe measures at 41 to 53%
slower. `--deal id` builds that single-module model, which is the right thing for a prefill-only run
and the wrong number for a step. The `--decode` steps are warmed (`--warmup`) and the warm-up is
printed on its own, because the window otherwise opens on whatever the prompt's last chunk left
behind; the deal's own price is not read off this column but off the interleaved step probe, and the
two arms here are two processes.

Usage:

    python tests/bench_mimo_v2_prefill.py --tokens 512 --chunk 512
    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 tests/bench_mimo_v2_prefill.py --tokens 2048 --chunk 2048
    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 tests/bench_mimo_v2_prefill.py --tokens 8192 --chunk 4096 --band 0
    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 tests/bench_mimo_v2_prefill.py \
        --tokens 262144 --chunk 2048 --band 16 --floor 0 --decode 2

The checkpoint is the default asset path; without it the script exits 0 and says so.
