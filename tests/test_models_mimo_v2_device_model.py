"""The assembled stack: what a token costs, and what it has to agree with.

`device_attention.py` and `device_experts.py` each answer a question about one layer.
This file is about the model: the embedding, forty-eight layers of two adds each, the
final norm and the head -- and the four things the assembly can get wrong while every
layer is right.

Three of them are the reference's own behaviour and are checked against it. The embedding
is not scaled by `sqrt(hidden)`. The head is not tied to it. A layer's residual is added in
the hidden dtype on both sides, and the routed sum is rounded once, where the kernel leaves
it in float32. The fourth is this stage's: the routed layers *share* one expert arena, so
the layer a draw belongs to is a property of the call, and a model that forgot to pass it
would fill the arena with the wrong layer's experts and be wrong in a way that looks like
a slow model rather than a broken one.

The synthetic half runs on the release's own config shape at miniature dimensions, with
every weight drawn from a seed and the experts stored as packed fp4 whose scales are
exactly one -- so the dense experts the host reads and the packed codes the kernel reads
are the same numbers, and a disagreement is a bug rather than a rounding. The router's gate
is built so that the draw is known in advance: with one-hot rows and a separating correction
bias the same two experts are chosen for every token, which is what lets the tests ask
*which* experts were staged instead of only how many.

The release half is the real thing: two layers of the 309B checkpoint -- layer 0, which is
global attention and a dense FFN, and layer 1, which is windowed attention and routed
experts -- against the host reference in float32, on a prompt fed one token at a time so the
cache is exercised. It goes through the mmap source and not the bank, because the bank is
149.81 GiB of this host's `/dev/shm` and a test that needs it is a test that only runs here.
