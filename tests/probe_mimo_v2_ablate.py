"""What each region of a MiMo-V2.6 decode token costs the *step*, by deleting it and timing.

Two things this box has measured are worth more than a profile here. The first is that the profiler's
own per-op accounting is inflated by a factor that moves between processes -- the same
`cudaMemcpyAsync` has been recorded at 32.9 and at 96.3 ms a token -- so a table of `self_cpu_time`
is a table of shares and not of milliseconds. The second is that this box has reported the same
configuration 184 and 245 ms in one afternoon, so a number is only readable next to another number
taken in the same process minutes apart.

So the arms run interleaved, one process, and each arm is the shipped model with one region replaced
by a function that returns the right shape and does nothing else. What it returns is wrong and the
point is not the token, it is the clock: the difference between an arm and the shipped arm, taken a
round at a time, is what that region costs the step. Every stub is installed on every rank at once,
so the collectives stay symmetric.

The stubs, and what each one deletes:

    copies      every region but the copy: the draws are the router's own and the copies, the
                ordering and the kernel are the shipped ones, so this is the floor a token cannot
                go under while the experts come over PCIe. With a resident set the copy it prices
                is the miss, which is the point of the pair below it.
    copyfloor   the same, with the draw *cached*: a repeated draw is a resident hit, so the only
                copies left are the admits. What it measures is the step if every draw were held.
    stage       `_stage`: the six copies a row. The kernel still runs, on stale arena rows.
    attention   `MimoV2DeviceAttention.forward`: the qkv projection, the RoPE, the softmax, the
                gather and the output projection. The cache still advances, on zeros, so the next
                step's bounds are the ones it would have had -- which is why this arm does *not*
                price the append, and `kv` does.
    kv          `MimoV2KVCache.append`'s two `index_copy_`, with the write cursor still advanced.
    router      `route`, deleted: the gate linear, the correction bias, the three `topk` and the draw.
                The stub caches the first draw and returns it, so it is *not* the router's price
                alone -- the expert path then stages the same two experts every layer and the resident
                set hits every layer, which is `copyfloor`'s saving on top of the router's. Use
                `pyrouter` for the router's own price and `tests/probe_mimo_v2_router_ab.py` for the
                one call's.
    pyrouter    `route` still called and still returned, but from `layers.gate_and_route` rather than
                from the C++ transcription: `_route_ops = None` on every routed layer. This is the
                one arm that is a difference of two *shipped* paths, the draw is a real draw, and
                nothing downstream of the router knows which of the two answered it -- so `shipped`
                minus this arm is exactly what the transcription buys. It prices 0 when the extension
                is not built, which the line the probe prints above the table will say.
    rope        `attention.rotate`, both calls: the rotation of the query and of the key. The
                unrotated row comes back instead, so the attention is wrong; what is priced is the
                rotation's own work, whichever way this build dispatches it -- and on a build with
                no `rotate` to patch it is `rope_rows` that is stubbed.
    pyrope      the rotation through `rope_rows` rather than through the kernel, which is a
                *restore*: `shipped` minus this is what `mimo_rope_rows` is worth. It prices 0 on
                a build whose layers carry no rotation switch, which is a build without the
                kernel -- the same shape `pyrouter` has at line 41.
    norms       the two `rms_norm` a layer -- `device_model.normalise`, which is where they are
                called from the layer.
    reduce      `ep.reduce`, the layer's `all_reduce` of the expert partial.
    experts     the whole `MimoV2DeviceExperts.forward`: the `tolist`, the deal, the stage, the kernel.
    all         every one of the above at once, which is the floor of the loop, the embedding, the
                head and the sampler with the layers reduced to two adds.

And the arms that add rather than delete, because they restore a path rather than remove one. Each
is priced as a difference of two *shipped* builds, which is the only difference this box can read:

    chunk-decode  forces every decode step through `attention_output`'s chunk path by answering
                  `decode_foldable` false, which is what the model did before `decode_output`
                  existed. `shipped` minus this arm is what the lean decode attention is worth,
                  and it is exact: the two arms are bit-identical, checked over 25 steps of a real
                  model before the arm was written.
    torchattn     `_decode_ops = None` on every attention module, so `decode_output` takes the
                  torch softmax block `mimo_decode_attention` replaced. This one is *not* exact --
                  the kernel is held to a bound against the block rather than to an equality -- so
                  read the hit rate beside the arm before reading its price: a moved draw is a
                  different number of experts over PCIe. `probe_mimo_v2_attention_ab.py` is the
                  same two arms with the draws held, which is the clean measurement; this arm is
                  the same price on the instrument the token table's numbers come from. Measured at
                  sixteen resident rows: `--steps 10 --warmup 3 --rounds 5 --arms
                  shipped,torchattn` reads **116.8 and 128.1 ms a token**, so **11.3 ms** with all
                  of it on the host (111.6 against 123.0) and the queue unchanged.
    pyrouter      as above: the router off the card and back in Python.
    pyrope        as above: the rotation off the card and back in `rope_rows`.
    inference-mode
                  the step run under `torch.inference_mode` rather than `torch.no_grad`, which is
                  the same promise about autograd with less bookkeeping on every dispatch. It is
                  exact and it is not a deletion, which makes it the only arm here that a shipped
                  build can simply adopt -- and it is the one arm that goes quiet once the shipped
                  build has adopted it, since a second `inference_mode` costs nothing. Read it
                  against the `shipped` column's own decorator, not as a claim about the mode.
    nosync        hands `forward` a *host* indices tensor holding the last draw it took, so the
                  `tolist` inside it returns without touching the stream. The experts staged are
                  then the previous draw's, so the arithmetic is wrong; what the arm prices is the
                  device-to-host round trip a layer, which is 47 syncs a token. A CPU indices
                  tensor is what makes this work at all -- the shipped path passes `rows` and not
                  the ids to the kernel, so the only thing that reads `indices` is the `tolist`.

The arms are subtractive and they do not add up to the shipped token: two of them overlap (the
`experts` arm contains the `stage` arm) and the residual is the loop's own Python, the residuals and
whatever the collection of stubs leaves behind, which is the number to look at when the sum of the
columns is short of the token.
