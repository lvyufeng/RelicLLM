"""The decode step's attention in one kernel: a bound instead of an equality, and why.

`device_attention.decode_output`'s softmax block is deliberately the reference's arithmetic on
smaller shapes -- two `matmul`s around a masked softmax with a sink column -- and what it costs is
dispatch rather than flops. Every tensor in it is at most `[16, 192]`, and at sixteen resident rows
it is `scores` 6.9 ms of a token's host, `softmax` 6.6, `out` 4.8 and the final `view` 0.8: 19.1 ms
for eighteen eager dispatches a layer, forty-eight layers a token.

`mimo_decode_attention` is that block as one kernel, and it is **the one kernel in the MiMo path
that is not bit-exact.** `mimo_rope_rows` could be exact because it is elementwise -- there is no
summation order to get wrong -- and this one has three: the reference's `sum` is a `torch`
reduction whose tree shape is torch's, its two matmuls are cuBLAS's blocking of the same products,
and the kernel walks the span a warp at a time. So the file is organised around what is *not* given
up and how far the answer moves, in that order:

* **The products are not approximated.** `key` and `value` are bfloat16 because the cache is, they
  are widened exactly the way the reference's `.to(torch.float32)` widens them, and a span of one
  key -- where the softmax is the identity and every non-widening step of the kernel cancels -- is
  `torch.equal` to the widened value row. That test is the whole claim in one line.
* **The exponentials are the reference's.** `--use_fast_math` is on for this translation unit and
  turns `expf` into `__expf`, whose few-2^-21 of relative error is the same order as the tolerance,
  so the kernel goes through `double`, which fast math does not substitute.
* **The sum is accumulated in double**, and for the same reason: a thousand keys against a float32
  accumulator is a thousand roundings, and measured over the release's own span that is 1.8e-6
  relative -- two thousand times the bfloat16 the answer is cast to.

What is left is the reference's own reassociation, and the last test in this file is what it costs
*on the token*: a float32 agreement of about 3e-7 relative, which is a hundred-and-twentieth of a
bfloat16 step, and a bfloat16 answer that moves only where that lands on a rounding boundary.
