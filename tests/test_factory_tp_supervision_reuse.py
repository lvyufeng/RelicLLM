"""Supervised TP setup must not leak rendezvous state between backends.

``create_backend`` spawns worker ranks and hands rank 0 the NCCL rendezvous path.
Anything it records process-wide survives the backend, so a second engine built
in the same process sees leftover state from the first.  These tests build two
backends in a row, which is what any benchmark comparing two configurations does.
