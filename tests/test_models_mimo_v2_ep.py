"""The draw, dealt out: who stages what, and whether the shares are the draw.

Two halves, and neither needs a process group.

The first is the deal itself, which is arithmetic and not communication: `id` gives a drawing to
`expert % world` and `sorted` gives sorted position `p` to rank `p % world`, and the difference
between them is the whole reason both exist. `sorted` deals a top-8 draw as exactly 2, 2, 2, 2 --
fixed, with no variance and no rank left out -- which is the decode shape. `id` partitions the
*experts*, so a rank is ever dealt from a quarter of them, which is what makes a prefill chunk stage
a quarter of its bytes; and it leaves a rank of four with nothing in 10% of top-8 draws, which is
not a corner case and is why the zero has to be a value rather than a skipped call.

The second is the arithmetic the deal is supposed to partition. Four ranks' partials are summed
*in this process* and held against the one-rank answer, which is the strongest statement available
without four cards: if the deal dropped a drawing, double-counted one, or paired a weight with the
wrong expert, the sum is not the draw. It is also the cheapest one, because a rank's module is just
another `MimoV2DeviceExperts` and the sum is four additions rather than a fabric.

What this does *not* test is the collective. `make_all_reduce` is a closure around
`dist.all_reduce` and there is nothing in it to get wrong; whether four processes on four cards
still agree is what the multi-rank bench and the four-rank decode comparison answer, and neither
is something a single-process test can stand in for. `make_all_gather` is the other one, and it
*does* have something to get wrong: the primitive joins along the first axis where the attention
wants the last, and a caller that allocates the shape it wants gets a silent scramble for any
`rows` over one. So the collective is faked here -- one function that writes the layout the real
one writes -- and the only question asked of it is where each rank's piece ended up.
