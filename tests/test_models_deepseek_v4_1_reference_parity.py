"""Parity between this repository's V4.1 backbone and the released `inference/model.py`.

`relicllm/models/deepseek_v4_1/` reimplements the released runtime rather than importing it, for the
reason `kernels.py` gives: the released `inference/kernel.py` needs TileLang and a tensor core this
host does not have. A reimplementation is only worth anything if something holds it to the original,
and prose cannot: the module tree has to reproduce the reference's *order of operations*, and the
places that matters -- the hc mix that one sublayer computes for the next, the clamp that happens
before the silu rather than after, the divide by `gate_temp` that neither released config states --
are exactly the ones a reviewer would not catch by reading both files side by side.

So this file runs both. It imports the released `model.py` with three of its dependencies stubbed,
builds the reference and this repository's `Backbone` from one `ModelArgs`, copies every reference
parameter into the matching slot here, and compares the logits of a prefill and the logits of the
decode step that follows it.

What the stubs mean for the result:

* `kernel` is bound to *this repository's* ops, not the reference's TileLang ones. So what the
  comparison measures is the module tree around attention -- `Block`, the hc mixing, `MoE`, `Gate`,
  `Engram` -- and not the attention ops, which `tests/test_models_deepseek_v4_1_kernels.py` and
  `tests/test_models_deepseek_v4_1_attention.py` cover separately. Running the reference's own
  kernel would compare two op sets at once and report a difference in either as a difference here.
* `vision` and `image_processor` are never reached: `vision_n_layers=0` and no `token_types`, and
  the engram hash is fed the reference's own output rather than a tokenizer's normalizer chain (see
  `_load_reference`), so the compressed token map -- `relicllm/models/deepseek_v4_1/engram.py`'s subject -- is the
  one piece of the reference's front end this file does not run.

The whole file skips when the released inference tree is not on this host, which is the same
condition `tests/test_models_deepseek_v4_1_tensor_audit.py` uses for the checkpoint.

    The reference is bf16 by construction and not by argument. `ModelArgs.dtype` names the *weight*
    storage its `Linear` wraps, and the pieces that are not `Linear` -- `Engram.q_weight`,
    `k_weight`, the indexer's projections, `ParallelHead` -- are written `torch.bfloat16` in
    `model.py` itself. So there is no width to build the reference at other than the one it
    declares, and this tree's dense stack is bf16 in production -- the same width, for a reason of
    its own that the page below records.

    Two widths cannot be compared exactly, which is what this file does. The weights are not why:
    every weight the reference holds is bf16, and bf16's 8 significand bits fit inside fp16's 11, so
    the copy is exact down to fp16's denormal floor of 2**-14. It is the *activations* -- a GEMM's
    inputs are cast to its weight's width, so a bf16 reference rounds them to 8 bits where this tree
    keeps 11, and over forty layers the two streams separate to about a tenth of the logit scale.
    That is arithmetic and not a defect, and it is why the comparison in this file is run at the
    reference's width.

    The dense width's own evidence is elsewhere and is not a tie-break this file can make: the
    same harness run at fp16 against the same bf16 reference reads a max|logit diff| of at most
    0.116 of the logit scale with the bf16 run as a zero control, recorded in
    `docs/performance/v41_dense_gemm_dtype.md` and reproduced by `probe_v41_dense_dtype_abab.py` on
    the real checkpoint. That arm is withdrawn as a shipping default on the same page -- fp16 has no
    room for the activations the chat renderer's own prompt reaches -- so the comparison here is at
    the reference's width for a second reason and not only because the reference is built there.

    Three modules and not one: `attention.py` and `modules.py` each hold the name, and `loader.py`
    binds it a third time (`from ...attention import LINEAR_DTYPE`), so a build that moved only the
    first two would leave any reader in the third at the old width. `CACHE_DTYPE` moves with it --
    not as a detail, but because the sparse-attention kernels dispatch on the query and read the
    cache, so a linear stack at one width over a cache at another is silent corruption rather than
    an error.

    A build is not the only reader, which is why this is called from a test-wide fixture rather than
    from `_build_pair`: `EngramTable.lookup` narrows to `LINEAR_DTYPE` *per call*, inside
    `Engram.forward`, so a build pinned and unpinned around construction leaves every weight at one
    width and hands the first `Engram.wkv` an activation at the other. The error that produces is
    `expected m1 and m2 to have the same dtype`, raised from a stock `nn.Linear` inside a module
    named nowhere in this file.
