"""The idle doorbell's protocol, exercised on real sockets and without a card or a process group.

What is under test here is the part of the doorbell that a hang would hide: rank 0's ring has to
reach a worker that is waiting, it has to reach one that is *not* waiting yet without being lost (the
channel counts rings rather than latching a flag), and a rank 0 that goes away has to end the wait
rather than park it forever. The waits that are supposed to block run on a daemon thread and are
joined with a timeout, so a protocol that stops delivering fails an assertion instead of hanging the
suite.

``tests/test_v41_backend.py`` covers the other half -- that ``_broadcast`` rings before it enters the
collective, and that ``_init_distributed`` opens the end of the doorbell its own rank needs.
