"""The dense tree cut four ways: what a rank owns, and that four ranks are one.

`tp.py` splits the tree *by construction* -- every module derives its own `1/world` slice from a
`world` -- while the loader has to cut the file's tensors the same way to fill it. Those are two
spellings of one arithmetic and they cannot be shared, because a constructor divides `n_heads` where
the loader has to divide `n_heads * head_dim` and land on a whole number of heads. So the tests
here are written to make the two halves fail against *each other* rather than against the released
checkpoint, which no test can hold:

* `test_the_loader_cuts_the_file_the_way_the_constructor_cut_the_parameter` -- every parameter of
  every rank against a post-hoc slice of the one-rank tree, name for name. This is the pair that
  drifts: a rank whose `wq_b` was built 16 heads wide and filled from a 32-head band still loads,
  still runs, and is wrong.
* `test_the_shards_partition_the_tensor_they_were_cut_from` -- the far end of the same claim: the
  pieces have to *cover* the whole, with no gap and no overlap. The reassembly below is spelled out
  from the projections' own shapes rather than read out of `tp.py`, so the two agree rather than
  agree with themselves.
* `test_a_sharded_forward_is_the_unsharded_forward` -- the tree run four ways at once and against one
  rank, on the same activation and the same weights, through a collective that is four threads and a
  barrier instead of a process group.

The forward test has to be honest about its own reach, and three of its limits are the fixture's or
the dtype's rather than the split's. The routed experts are not dealt out here -- the mini
checkpoint's store holds all 384 of a layer and sums them on the host -- so four ranks compute the
same routed sum and the ffn's all-reduce completes the shared expert's partial *alone*; that is why
`MoE.forward` reduces the shared half and not the total, and
`test_the_ffn_completes_the_routed_partial_only_when_the_store_was_dealt_out` is what covers the
other branch, where the two halves travel on one message. The mini geometry's `index_topk` is wide
enough that no block is ever truncated, so a tie in the indexer's selection cannot arise here: the
discrete half of `probe_tp4_block.py`'s parity check has nothing to catch on this checkpoint, and
what the logits comparison below covers is the arithmetic. And the arithmetic is bf16, where a
row-parallel partial is rounded before it is summed, so the comparison is between two roundings of
one value rather than between two spellings of it -- `_close` states the bound that follows and how
it is derived.

    The *discrete* claim is the picks. Every rank computes the ids for its own rows and one all-gather

    produced -- not a permutation of it. That is what a band off by a row fails, and it fails here
    rather than as a logit margin. The hook is on `Indexer.forward`'s return value, which is the
    gathered tensor: a rank's band is never visible outside the module.

    The *continuous* one is `_close`, at the same bound the head split is held to, because the row
    split changes nothing about `wo_b` or the shared expert -- still column-parallel partials rounded
    to bf16 before the all-reduce. What it does change is the indexer's score, which is now summed
    over all 32 heads in one rank, in the oracle's own order, instead of over 8 heads on each of four
    ranks and then rounded by a collective. The indexer is closer to the oracle here, not further.

    The decode steps in the loop are the *head* split: one query is below the world, so `row_band`
    hands back the whole chunk and the module takes its `_wq_b_for_heads` cut. That is deliberate --

    carry the layer: the weights are `layers.{layer}.ffn.experts.{expert}.{which}.weight`, so a pool
    holding another layer's expert under the same id must not answer this layer's draw. That was the
    bug the 512-token sweep found (`pool_row`'s own docstring has the numbers) and the last two cases
    below are its regression test, at the level where it is decidable without four cards.

    Checked hand in hand with the miss list, because the number of rows a row is dealt is also what
    `drawn_rows` counts -- the denominator the coverage of a resident set is reported over, which is
    the number that was wrong the first time this was measured.

    Called on a stub, the way the two tests above are: the split, the map and the counters are host
    arithmetic, and everything else in the class needs the packed checkpoint and four cards. The stub
    binds `_resolve_row`/`_stage_misses` and not only `_stage_row`, so what it drives is the same
    two halves the batched path runs for a whole batch -- the resolution that must move nothing and
    the staging that must happen exactly once a row.

    Two things have to hold for the batched path to be the per-row path's answer and not a different
    one, and neither is a shape. **Every row is resolved before any row is staged**, in row order,
    because the pool's state after the batch has to be the state the row loop would have left it in
    -- and at `hot_rows > 0` more than that, since `_fill` chose which experts deserve a resident row
    from the whole batch's routing. **And the pipeline survives the wider unit**: a chunk's drain is
    entered after the *next* chunk has been issued, which is the only ordering in the class that is
    not free to change. **A row with nothing to move is not a stage**: it takes no buffer and issues
    no copy, so a batch the pool answers entirely neither waits nor writes, and the buffer rotation
    advances only over the rows that do -- which is what keeps a slot's copy a whole *staging* old.

    Counted on a stub whose resolve, chunk and stage are the real ones and whose issue and drain are
    recorded instead of run, since the point is the order of the calls and not what is on the cards.
