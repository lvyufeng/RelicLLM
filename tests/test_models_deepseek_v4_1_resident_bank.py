"""Contract tests for `src/models/deepseek_v4_1/resident_bank.py`.

The bank exists to make one claim true: after it is filled, a routed expert's bytes and an Engram
row's bytes come from host memory and not from `/mnt/data3`. Two things can make that claim false
while every counter still looks right, and they are what this file tests.

**The offsets.** The bank reproduces the shard's own byte order and then hands out views into its own
segment, so its offset arithmetic is the only thing standing between a kernel and a permutation of
the right bytes. The release does not order experts numerically -- `layers.0.ffn.experts.100.*` sits
between expert 10's and expert 11's, because the names are sorted as strings -- so an implementation
that placed expert `e` at `e * per_expert_bytes` would be plausible, self-consistent, and wrong for
all 384 experts. The test that catches it fills a real segment from a real shard and compares every
one of a layer's 2,304 tensors against the checkpoint's own view of the same tensor. It needs the
checkpoint and skips without it. The same arithmetic moves the two Engram tables, and
`test_a_filled_bank_hands_back_what_the_shard_holds` runs that half end to end on a synthetic
checkpoint, so the wiring is checked on the hosts that have no `/mnt/data3`.

**The layout check.** `_layout` is asserted rather than assumed, and the assertions are the design:
each kind is one contiguous range (that is what makes the fill 80 reads rather than 92,160), and the
projections cycle `w1, w2, w3` across that range (that is what makes the slot map a grouping and not
a coincidence). These are checked against synthetic entries, so they run everywhere and pin the
failure mode -- a release that grouped by projection would still be contiguous, and would put expert
5's `w1` into expert 0's `w3` slot.

A third claim, and the reason both regions are in one segment rather than two: a key the bank does
not hold must still be readable. The dense tree is 16.79 GiB that is deliberately *not* resident, so
`packed` has to answer for it from the mapping -- and a bank that answered with a plausible zero, or
that claimed a key it had no slot for, would fail silently rather than loudly.
