"""Is a restored prefix the state the same prefix would have built from scratch?

A prefix cache is only sound if a *resume* is the same forward as a cold prefill cut at the same
place, and that is a claim about the layers' caches rather than about the logits one request happens
to produce. `tests/test_models_deepseek_v4_1_chunked_prefill.py` pins the first half of it -- a chunk
boundary is not a new kind of forward -- and this file pins the second: the state *before* that
boundary can be put back on the host and reloaded into a wiped module without the continuation
noticing. The two together are the whole of what makes a request that starts with another request's
tokens safe to answer from the first request's leftovers.

The arms below are cut at every split point of a twelve-token prompt rather than at a few, because
the anchoring rules have no privileged length: an odd cut lands inside a compressor group, a cut at
the window lands on the ring's own boundary, and `N_TOKENS - 1` leaves a one-token tail, which is not
a continuation at all but the decode path -- the case a request one token longer than a stored prefix
degenerates to. What the store does with a request that is *exactly* a stored prefix is the other
thing this file has to say, and it is not a forward: see `Entry.logits`.

The store's own rules are tested apart from the model, on a payload that is a few tensors: which
anchor wins, what a miss falls back to, what the budget evicts, and what a sliced snapshot carries.
None of those needs a card and none of them is about the numbers.

    The obvious rule for an exact repeat is to restore the state the prompt left and forward its last
    token again at its own position, and the reason it is wrong is worth a test rather than a
    comment: for the ring and for the Engram hash cache it is idempotent -- both are pure functions of
    the position -- but the compressor is a *recurrence*. The row a group leaves behind is built from
    every position in it, so a replay at a position that *closes* its group emits that row from one
    token where the row belongs to `ratio` of them; and a replay in the *middle* of a group adds a
    position the restored state has already counted. Either way the row a later query reads is wrong,
    which is a divergence no correct answer can be tolerant of.

    The two arms below are the controlled pair. From the same restored snapshot, the continuation a
    correct resume runs -- the next token at its own position -- is exact, and the replay is not, so
    what differs is the replay and not the restore. (`test_every_split_point_resumes_to_the_same_state`
    pins the continuation arm at every cut, and `test_a_one_token_tail_is_the_decode_path_and_not_the
    _continuation_one` pins that the one forward the replay *is* has the same arithmetic as the prefill
    query it is compared against.) The damage is one compressor row, and the buffer set says so: layer
    2 closes a ratio-2 group at the last prompt token, so `layers.2.compress_kv_cache` and the
    `k_cache` cut from its latent carry the wrong row; every layer's attention at that position read
    it, so each ring keeps a different row for it; and the difference in layer 2's output is what
    layers 4 and 5 see as input, which is why their own compressed row for the position differs too.

    The test asserts the divergence, so it fails if the compressor ever becomes position-addressed and
    the cheap rule becomes sound. What the store does instead is keep the last row of logits beside
    the snapshot -- see `Entry.logits` -- which makes an exact repeat cost no forward at all.
