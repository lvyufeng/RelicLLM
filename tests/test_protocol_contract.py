"""The request-field contract: what this server refuses, and what it says.

Ported from ``cpp_engine/tests/test_openai_request_fields.cpp``, which checked the same table on
every C++ build and goes away with the native front end. The cases are the same because the policy
is the same -- a field whose value would have changed the answer is refused by name rather than
answered as if it had not been sent -- and the split into shape and capability cases is the one the
port introduced: shape holds on every runtime, capability is one adapter's answer.
