"""One program runs every supervised worker rank; what differs is a registry entry.

The program was generated as source text once per runtime and the three copies were the same
forty lines apart from three fields. These tests are about the replacement: a constant program,
a registry, and the fields that are still genuinely per-runtime.

The construction is faked rather than really run -- a real one loads a checkpoint -- so what is
asserted is the *contract*: what the child rebuilds from its environment, and when it announces
itself. A test that loaded a model would be measuring something else.
