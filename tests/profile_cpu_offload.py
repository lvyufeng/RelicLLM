"""Measure the ceiling for layer-granularity CPU offloading on this host.

Issue #156 ("CPU Offloading with Prefetch Pipeline") promises four things: a 70B
FP4 checkpoint runnable on a 2080 Ti, decode at >= 5 tok/s, prefetch hiding more
than 80% of the H2D traffic, and token parity.  None of those has been measured
here, and the roadmap arithmetic behind them
(`docs/architecture/pocketllm_roadmap_old_hardware.md`, section 2.1) does not
close on its own terms: it budgets ~100 ms of H2D and ~100 ms of compute per
layer, which for a 70B FP4 layer is wrong in both terms.

Roadmap entry 15 of #151 asks for exactly this before any throughput is
promised:

    Start with real-checkpoint memory and transfer profiles, distinguish cold
    storage from warm host-cache behavior, and establish the overlap ceiling
    before promising throughput.

This script produces those numbers.  It changes no runtime path and is not an
engine feature: it exists so that a go/no-go on layer-granularity offload can be
made from measurements rather than from the plan's arithmetic.

Note the distinction the existing offload paths in this repository rely on.
Every CPU/GPU mixed path here is *expert*-granular -- GLM's active-expert
staging, the Qwen4-Exp host-resident expert shard, the cpp_engine GGUF Q2
staging.  Expert granularity works because MoE routes each token to a handful of
experts, so most expert bytes never move at all.  *Layer* granularity (llama.cpp
`--gpu-layers N`) moves every weight of every offloaded layer on every token.
The two are not comparable budgets, and only the second is what #156 asks for.

Stages
------
`--stage storage`
    Sequential read bandwidth per mount, cold and warm.  Cold means the sampled
    file's own pages were evicted with `posix_fadvise(POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED)`;
    this never drops the whole page cache, which would perturb unrelated work on
    a shared machine.

`--stage h2d`
    Host-to-device bandwidth against copy size, pinned and pageable, one GPU and
    four GPUs concurrently, plus a NUMA-local/remote A/B for pinned buffers.
    Establishes where copies stop being latency-bound, which sets the smallest
    useful double-buffer chunk.

`--stage overlap`
    The core number: copy-only, compute-only, serial and double-buffered overlap
    for a real layer's byte count and a real layer's arithmetic, at decode (1
    row) and prefill (512 rows) shapes.  Reports the fraction of the copy the
    pipeline hides.

`--stage budget`
    Metadata only -- no tensor data is read.  Per-layer byte counts, the dense
    versus routed-expert split, per-rank footprint at TP1/2/4, how many layers
    fit in a 22 GiB card, and the arithmetic token-rate ceiling given the
    bandwidth measured above.

Usage
-----
    python tests/profile_cpu_offload.py --stage all \
        --json /tmp/cpu_offload_profile.json

See `docs/performance/cpu_offload_profile.md` for the recorded run and
`docs/guides/benchmarking.md` for the reporting rules this follows.
