"""What the router costs the host, and what the C++ transcription of it costs instead.

`probe_mimo_v2_ablate.py` prices the router by deleting it, and that arm is only half honest: the
stub caches the first draw and returns it forty-seven times, so the expert path stages the same two
experts every layer and the resident set hits every layer. The arm's 36.5 ms is the router *and* the
copies a fixed draw does not make. So the router is priced here instead, directly: the two
implementations, on the release's own shapes, alternating in one process, with nothing else running.

Every routed layer in this checkpoint has the same router -- a `[256, 4096]` gate, a `[256]`
correction bias, and one row of hidden during a decode step -- so a micro-benchmark of one call is a
micro-benchmark of all forty-seven, and the print multiplies it out with that stated.

Values are random and it does not matter: the two paths run the same kernels on the same arguments,
which is the claim, and the point here is the clock rather than the arithmetic. The equality is
checked anyway, once, because a kernel that is fast and wrong should not be reported as fast.
