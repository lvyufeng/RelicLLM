"""Feed a checkpoint into the V4.1 tree, and check the three things a load can get wrong.

`src/models/deepseek_v4_1/loader.py` is the only place that knows which name in a shard is which
parameter in the tree, which of them are quantized, and how an Engram row is addressed. None of that
can be checked against the released 476 GiB checkpoint from a test that has to run anywhere, so what
is here is a *miniature* checkpoint written to `tmp_path`: the same names in the same layouts, over a
toy geometry small enough to enumerate. Loading it exercises the whole path -- the `weight`/`scale`
pairing, the derived block width, the fp4 expert rebanking, the Engram row gather -- and the
assertions are against values computed in this file, not against the loader's own output.

Three of these tests are about the checkpoint's *shape* rather than its numbers, and they correspond
to real properties of the release:

* a KV source layer whose `compress_ratio` is 1 has no `compressor.wgate` -- layer 20 of the released
  model, and layer 4 of the geometry below -- so a per-KV-source key list would be wrong;
* the routed experts are `ffn.experts.{j}.w{k}` in the file and one stacked `ffn.routed.w{k}` in the
  tree, so a name-for-name copy would leave the entire MoE at `torch.empty`;
* the vision tower, the aligner, the image tokens and the DSpark draft layers are wanted by nothing
  the text backbone builds, and the report counts them rather than passing over them in silence.

`EngramHashIds` needs none of that. It is a second *formulation* of `src/encoding/engram.NgramHasher`
-- which is stdlib-only, and therefore a real oracle -- and the tests below hold the two to the same
ids on a token stream split across a prefill and a decode. That comparison is the reason the tensor
version is allowed to exist, and the split is the case a cache exists for: a port that re-reads the
prompt instead of carrying it agrees with the reference on a whole prefill and disagrees on step two.
