"""Does the CSA2 layer stack hold together as a stack, without a checkpoint to compare against?

`src/models/deepseek_v4_1/attention.py` is the V4.1 attention half written out in pure PyTorch.
There is no oracle for it on this host: the released runtime implements its ops in TileLang, which
needs `torch>=2.10.0` (this environment is on 2.9.1), and the sm_75 cards here have no FP4 tensor
core. So, as with `test_models_deepseek_v4_1_kernels.py`, nothing below claims to reproduce the
released model's tokens. What is checked is the internal arithmetic that *is* decidable:

* **Prefill and decode agree.** The same twelve tokens, once in a single forward and once as twelve
  one-token forwards, must produce the same output. That is the property every later measurement
  rests on -- a KV cache that only works because prefill and decode are never compared is not a
  cache -- and it exercises the whole mechanism at once: the sliding-window ring buffer, the
  compressor's group accumulation across forwards, the index-key cache, and the four shared slots
  `SharedAttentionRuntime` carries down the stack.
* **The compressed indices are causal.** A query at position `p` may attend to compressed position
  `j` only when group `j` has already closed, i.e. `j < (p + 1) // compress_ratio`, and the `-1`
  padding fills exactly the rest of the `index_topk` width.
* **The shared slots are wired the way the modes say.** Only `kv_source_layers` own an index key
  cache; only `candidate_source_layer` writes the candidate mask; only layers *after* it read one.
* **The recorded step is the eager step.** A decode step of the whole stack is recorded into a CUDA
  graph, replayed at the position it was recorded at and again at a later one, and both replays have
  to reproduce the eager step bit for bit. That is the constraint `graphs.py` is built on -- the
  graph is the shipped decode path -- and it is the one two faults in this file broke without any
  test here noticing: a `Pos + int` that raised while the step was being recorded, and a boolean a
  recorded body read back to the host, which a capture refuses outright.

One measurement shaped the config below and is worth stating, because it looks like a bug otherwise.
`index_topk` truncation makes prefill and decode differ, and the difference is a **tie artifact, not
an arithmetic error**: with `index_topk` smaller than the number of reachable compressed positions,
every mismatch lands on a query whose k-th and (k+1)-th scores are equal, so prefill's wider score
matrix breaks the tie differently than decode's narrower one. Sweeping eight seeds found no mismatch
at a position whose k-th score was distinct, and layers isolated one at a time agreed exactly until
the first truncated index source. With `index_topk` and `candidate_topk_blocks` large enough that
nothing is truncated, the two orderings are bit-identical. So the toy config sets both wide, and the
assertion is equality rather than a tolerance -- a tolerance here would hide exactly the class of
error the test exists to catch.

# every position the graph is replayed at. Two faults in this file broke that and neither was visible
# here. `Backbone.forward`'s `start_pos + c0` raised inside `capture_pass` on a chunked prompt,
# because `start_pos` is a `Pos` there and `Pos + int` was not defined. `_TopKStream.push`'s early-out

    """The step a graph replays has to be the step the card would have computed eagerly.

    Everything the recorded body reads lives in a tensor allocated before the capture: the token in
    `move`, and the position in the `Pos` the graph was recorded with, which `set` refills between
    replays. That is the whole point of the exercise -- a step that read either off the host would
    replay at the position and with the token it was recorded at, which is the failure `Pos` exists
    to prevent and the one a bit-for-bit comparison against the eager path is able to see.

    The tiles are shrunk so the running top-k actually saturates. At the toy config's own widths a
    decode step's candidate set is a single tile, `push` is called once per stream, and the width it
    holds is the width of that one tile -- so the early-out's condition, which needs a saturated
    buffer, is never reached and the recorded body would be identical with or without the guard. The
    real model is the other way round: 2048 candidate blocks against `index_topk` 512 saturate on the
    first push, so the condition is evaluated on every push after it, which is where the capture died.

    `saturated` is what keeps this test from passing for the wrong reason. It counts pushes that left
    the buffer at its full width, which is the state the early-out branches on, and it asserts the
    count is non-zero -- a run where no stream ever saturated would still compare equal here even if
    the guard were missing.

    positions would be off by a block everywhere downstream.

    means the first tile holds the whole top-k and every later tile is below it, so the skip is

    shape the skip was written for. `_stream_candidates` builds its stream with
    `k = min(index_topk, width)`, which is exactly this tiling's `span`: the field being narrowed is
    already the top-k's own width, so the running k-th value is drawn from the same distribution as
