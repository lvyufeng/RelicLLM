"""The MiMo adapter's request path, exercised without a checkpoint and without a card.

Neither half of the runtime can be stood up here: the checkpoint is 150 GiB of experts on a host
bank and the tree wants four cards. Both are therefore injected -- a scripted stand-in for the
model and a table for the tokenizer -- and what is asserted is everything the adapter and the
generation loop themselves decide:

* which prompt a request becomes, and that a chat is rendered by the template the checkpoint ships
  rather than by a generic one;
* that a greedy request is one chunked prefill and one step a token, and one step fewer than the
  tokens it returned;
* that the loop stops on the checkpoint's own end-of-turn tokens, on the caller's budget, on a
  cancel, and on a stop string -- and that the text a stop string truncates is not sent;
* that a stream sends the same text as the unstreamed call, holds back a tail that is still half a
  stop string, and never sends a replacement character;
* that a request the run's cache cannot hold is refused before the loop starts;
* that the launcher's levers reach the model, and that a lever the adapter does not know is a
  refusal rather than a silently ignored key.

What is *not* covered, and cannot be: the four-card collectives. The per-step cancel broadcast is
built but not entered -- ``_step_sync`` returns a local flag at a world of one, which is what every
test here runs as -- and nothing below has been run against the released checkpoint or its real
tokenizer; the acceptance run for that is ``docs/models/mimo-v2.6-flash.md``.
