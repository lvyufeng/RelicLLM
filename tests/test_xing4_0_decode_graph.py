"""The bucketed, captured decode step, held against the eager one it replaces.

`relicllm/models/xing4_0/graphs.py` makes three claims and each has a test here rather than a comment:

* **a bucket is free at its end** — a step at the last position of a bucket reads exactly the rows it
  would read unbucketed and masks nothing, so its logits are bit-identical to the eager path's;
* **a replay is the same arithmetic as an eager submission at the same width** — the two arms differ
  in how the ops reach the card and in nothing else, so `torch.equal` is the assertion and not a
  tolerance;
* **the loop is unchanged** — the greedy chain a `DecodeGraphs` produces is the chain the eager path
  produces, token for token, across a bucket boundary.

## The fixture is a truncation of the released checkpoint, and why

`BLOCKS = 4` loads the checkpoint's own first four blocks — its embedding, its attention, its
hyper-connection, and (from `first_k_dense_replace 2`) two dense and two MoE blocks — with the real
released weights and the real kernels. What is being tested is the mechanism: an index tensor written
by a graph, a mask expressed against a device position, and an `N` that a recording can hold. Every
one of those happens 40 times a step in exactly the form it happens 4 times here, so depth is not a
variable in any of these properties, and 4 blocks costs 2.31 GiB and 4.8 s against the full model's
17.84 GiB and 13 s. The claims that *do* depend on the whole checkpoint — the per-step milliseconds,
the pool, and the end-to-end rate — are measured on the full model in
`docs/performance/xing4_0_decode_graph.md` rather than asserted here.

The released tokenizer supplies the prompts, so the token ids and the bucket boundary a run crosses
are real rather than chosen.
