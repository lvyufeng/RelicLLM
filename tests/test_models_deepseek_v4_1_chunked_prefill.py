"""Does a prompt split into chunks produce what the same prompt in one forward produces?

`Backbone.forward(..., chunk=n)` exists because two activations a forward holds are linear in the
sequence length and neither is needed past the row it is computed on: the Hyper-Connections mixing
is `[s, hc_mult * dim]` fp32 -- 21 GiB at 256K -- and `main_hiddens` is another 8 GiB. Splitting the
prompt is what puts 256K inside a 22 GiB card, and it is only a *reasonable* way to do that if the
chunks compose into the same forward. That is what this file checks, and it is checked at the level
where the composing happens: the layers' caches. A chunked prompt leaves the sliding-window ring, the
compressed-KV cache, the index-key cache and the compressor's partial group in the same state a
one-shot prompt leaves them in, so the tokens that come out of the two are the same tokens.

Three things have to hold for that and each is a test below.

* **The window is a window, not a chunk.** A query in a later chunk sees `window_size` positions
  that reach back *past its own chunk*, into rows the earlier chunk wrote into the ring. The ring is
  written and read by absolute position (`slot = position % window_size`) on both paths, and the
  continuation body hands `sparse_attn` the ring and the chunk concatenated so that a position can
  be named by which half it fell in. The row that comes out is the same *positions* in the same
  *order* as the one-shot row -- oldest first, which is the order the prefill branch emits and the
  order the sparse attention's denominator sums in. Same vectors, same order, same sum.
* **A group is `compress_ratio` positions, not `compress_ratio` tokens of a chunk.** A chunk boundary
  lands inside a group in general, so the first tokens of a chunk close a group the previous chunk
  opened; those tokens pool *in the state*, where that group's earlier tokens are. A trailing partial
  group waits in the state for the next chunk to close it. The compressor's own state is compared
  after a chunked prompt and after a one-shot prompt for exactly this reason.
* **The indexer reaches what the query can reach.** `compress_lens` is counted from absolute
  position, and the reachable prefix is `pos.group(ratio, seqlen)` groups wide -- a chunk's first
  query can see the whole history in front of it, and a count that started at 0 would mask all of it.

The comparison is `torch.equal` and not a tolerance, at a chunk width chosen so nothing is
truncated: `index_topk` is wide enough for every reachable compressed position, so the two orderings
select the same `k` vectors and the difference between them is a different grouping of the same
additions rather than a different answer. That is the same standard
`test_models_deepseek_v4_1_attention.py` holds prefill and token-by-token decode to, and the same
reason a tolerance would be wrong here: an off-by-one in the ring would land inside a tolerance and
change the answer those cards produce.
