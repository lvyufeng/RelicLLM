"""The V4.1 adapter's request path, exercised without a checkpoint and without a card.

Neither half of the runtime can be built on this host: ``load_backbone`` wants 476 GiB across four
cards, and ``generate`` wants the tree that loader returns. Both are therefore injected -- a
stand-in for the loaded backbone and a scripted stand-in for the loop -- and what is asserted here
is everything the adapter itself decides:

* which prompt a request becomes, and that it is the checkpoint's own ``encoding/encoding.py``
  rather than a jinja template (this checkpoint ships no ``chat_template`` at all);
* that a request the attention caches cannot hold is refused on rank 0 *before* the broadcast,
  because a rank that refuses after it leaves its peers in a collective nobody enters;
* that a stop string ends the generation with the text up to the marker rather than with the
  tokens the loop had already produced past it;
* that a thinking-mode stream is split as it arrives, each half diffed against what was already
  sent rather than re-sent;
* that a stream sends the *answer*: the tool-call block V4.1 writes as plain text is withheld from
  the content and reported as a call on the last event, and a decode tail that is still half a
  character is held back and then sent, so neither the format's markup nor a replacement character
  reaches a client;
* that the loop's own decode figure travels with the result, and that when the loop unwinds on a
  stop string -- where no ``Generation`` comes back at all -- the wall minus the first token's wait
  is what is left of it;
* that the prompt store is this rank's and lasts the process, that the CLI switch is the one off
  switch over it, that what the loop reused reaches ``usage.prompt_tokens_details``, and that its
  counters are published under the request lock rather than walked from the scrape thread.

The encoder is written into a temporary checkpoint directory as a real file, because that is what
the adapter reads: the format belongs to the checkpoint, so the loader has to find
``encoding/encoding.py`` under the path it was pointed at, render through it, and fall back to the
tolerant split when the checkpoint's own parser will not accept the text. The tokenizer is a stub
for the same reason, and it pins two details that are easy to get wrong and expensive to get wrong
in production: ``add_special_tokens=False`` on a rendered prompt that already opens with its own
beginning-of-sentence token, and a raw completion prompt that goes to the tokenizer verbatim.

What is *not* covered here, and cannot be: no V4.1 checkpoint exists on this host, so nothing below
has been run against the released encoder or a real tokenizer, and the four-card collectives
(``_broadcast``, the per-step ``all_reduce``) are stubbed rather than entered.
