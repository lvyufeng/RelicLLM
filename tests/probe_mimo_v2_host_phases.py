"""What a MiMo-V2.6 decode token's host is doing, split by the module that asked for it.

`probe_mimo_v2_decode_host.py` says the step is the host: at a short context a token is 178 ms of a
returning `model.step()` and 6 ms of queue behind it. That probe answers *how much*; this one answers
*where*, because the answer decides what a kernel is worth.

The instrument is `time.perf_counter` around each module's own entry point and nothing else -- no CUDA
events, no profiler. That is deliberate: the profiler's own accounting is inflated by a factor that
varies between processes (the same `cudaMemcpyAsync` has been recorded at 32.9 and at 96.3 ms a
token), and a CUDA event pair on a host-bound step measures the host's own starvation rather than the
region it was put around. Wall time around a call attributes exactly what the caller paid.

The regions nest, and the print says which is inside which:

    layer            the whole layer, attention and MLP together
      attention        `MimoV2DeviceAttention.forward`, gather included
      router           `layer.route`, the gate and the draw
      expert wrapper   `MimoV2DeviceExperts.forward` -- the `tolist`, the deal and the kernel call
        expert stage     `_stage`, which is host time only: the copies themselves are on the stream
        expert kernel    the kernel's own Python entry
      norms            the two `normalise` calls a layer

so `layer` minus its children is the residuals and the loop's own Python, and the token minus every
`layer` is the embedding, the final norm, the head and the sampler.

The overhead of the probe is itself measured and printed as `-- `, because a probe that adds 280
`perf_counter` pairs a token is a probe whose own number is not the step's: on a host-bound step the
honest total is `probe_mimo_v2_decode_host.py`'s, and this one is read for its shares.

Usage:

    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 tests/probe_mimo_v2_host_phases.py --steps 8
    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 tests/probe_mimo_v2_host_phases.py --steps 8 --depth 4096 --fill
    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 tests/probe_mimo_v2_host_phases.py --steps 8 --depth 4096 \
        --resident-rows 16

`--depth` prefills a real document by default, because at a non-zero `--resident-rows` a written
cache is not the same step: its draws repeat, the resident set answers far more of them, and the
`expert wrapper` line comes out smaller than it would over a prompt. `--fill` writes the positions
instead, which is seconds against minutes and is the arm the region table in the model page was taken
at -- with `--resident-rows 0` it is faithful, because every draw is staged either way.
