"""IQ4_NL in the GGUF loader: the codebook, the 32-weight geometry, and the two
places the type is and is not declared.

Three halves, and they answer three different questions.  The hermetic half
builds a tiny GGUF whose payload is real IQ4_NL blocks and checks that the
loader's arithmetic is the format's: the codebook comes out of the vendored
llama.cpp header, and the nibble order is the block layout rather than an
alternating one.  The row-width half is the regression this task exists for --
``IQ4_NL`` blocks are 32 weights where every other format in the loader is 256,
so a reader that assumes ``QK_K`` reads the wrong bytes instead of failing.
The runtime half is what #393 changed: the type *is* a kernel claim now, so the
loader regroups the native blocks into the 256-weight row element the kernels
are written against, and the empty loader-only category says the loader decodes
nothing that nothing runs.

The checkpoint half is the acceptance criterion: the released GGUF's own
``IQ4_NL`` tensors are compared against the same tensor names in the
checkpoint's BF16 release, which the repository ships alongside.  It skips
unless both files are on disk.

    The comparison is on an expert slab rather than a whole tensor: the GGUF packs
    the 64 experts into one three-dimensional tensor and the BF16 release keeps
    them apart, so the mapping from ``blk.2.ffn_gate_exps.weight`` expert 0 to
    ``model.layers.2.mlp.experts.0.gate_proj.weight`` is part of what is being
    checked.  It goes through ``read_routed_expert_blocks`` -- the entry point a
    kernel will read -- so the raw-block addressing is on the critical path too.
