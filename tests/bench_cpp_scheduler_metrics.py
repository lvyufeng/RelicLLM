"""Does the Python server's own ``/metrics`` show one scheduler holding several requests?

`bench_pocketllm_serve_concurrency.py` measures what concurrency buys. This measures the thing
underneath it: that two concurrent arrivals land in **one** scheduler with a non-empty running set,
rather than in a lock that serializes them. The distinction matters because a lock produces the same
token counts and the same answers -- a concurrency benchmark that only reads responses cannot tell
the two apart, and an implementation that quietly serialized would look like a slower scheduler
rather than like no scheduler.

The evidence is the server's own exposition. `pocketllm_requests_running` is a gauge the server
reads off the live `BatchScheduler`, and it is the same gauge, from the same stats struct, that the
native host publishes as `pocket_requests_running` -- one scheduler library, two hosts, so the two
servers agree up to the metric prefix. This script samples it while a group of requests is in
flight and reports the peak, which is the number a serialized server cannot produce.

The requests are non-streamed. The cpp adapter's streaming path still holds a lock across the whole
generation, so a streamed run would measure that lock rather than the scheduler; that is a known gap
and it is recorded as such in the guide, not hidden by this script's choice.

Run both modes to see the contrast -- the serial arm is the null:

    python tests/bench_cpp_scheduler_metrics.py --port 8123
    python tests/bench_cpp_scheduler_metrics.py --port 8124 --no-enable-batching

Example:
    python tests/bench_cpp_scheduler_metrics.py \\
        --port 8123 --concurrent 4 --max-tokens 64 --json-out /tmp/scheduler_metrics.json
