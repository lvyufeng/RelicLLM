"""Xing4.0-29B-A4B's MoE, against the checkpoint's own router and experts.

The block is DeepSeek's mixture-of-experts with three differences that each get
a test rather than a comment:

- the router selects with a sigmoid score plus a correction bias and weights by
  the *unbiased* score, which is a distinction that survives every shape check;
- the routed experts are IQ4_NL blocks run through the shared grouped kernel, so
  they need a parity test against a dense evaluation of the same weights;
- top-k is four, and four is the smallest count at which the kernel's
  `atomicAdd` reduction stops being reproducible, so the determinism is asserted
  rather than assumed.

The reference for the first is a line-by-line port of `Xing4_0TopkRouter` and
`Xing4_0MoE`, both read from the checkpoint's own `modeling_xing4_0.py`.  The
device tests need a CUDA build and the released GGUF; the host test needs a real
shard.
