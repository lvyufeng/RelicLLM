"""Does `Pos` return the objects the lines it replaces used to build, on both paths?

`src/models/deepseek_v4_1/decode_pos.py` exists for one reason: a CUDA graph freezes every Python
value it records, so `start_pos` has to reach the card as an index tensor before a decode step can be
replayed at a moving position. The whole risk of that change is that the *eager* path -- which is
what every number on the V4.1 pages was measured with, and the column the graph is compared against
token by token -- quietly starts computing something else.

So the test is a differential one. For every site the six methods serve, the int path has to produce
exactly what the expression it replaced produced: `slice(start_pos, start_pos + n)` for `span`,
`start_pos % win` for `slot`, `start_pos + offset` for `row`, and the same `bool` for `first` and
`emits`. The device path is then held to the same values through the index tensors, checked by
indexing a real cache with both and requiring the results to be equal -- which is the property the
call sites actually rely on, since PyTorch takes ints, slices and index tensors interchangeably in
`cache[...]` and nothing else in the module promises the two are the same object.

One thing here is not a value check: **`emits` is computed from `pos.host` rather than from the
tensor**, because the answer picks which of two captured bodies a replay runs and therefore has to
be known before the launch. A test that only compared it to the literal expression on a host `int`
would not notice if a later edit read it off the card, so the device path is checked at a position
where the tensor and the host integer are deliberately different.

`publish` is the module's other half and its risk is the opposite one: it is *only* correct in a
capture, an ordinary call cannot tell the two behaviours apart. Its section below therefore ends
with a real capture, refills the buffer, replays, and requires the replayed value to be there --
which a value that lived in the recording's own pool would not be.

Every device case skips on a host without a card rather than being asserted in software, because the
dtype, the layout and the cost of the object are the point and a CPU tensor is not any of them.
