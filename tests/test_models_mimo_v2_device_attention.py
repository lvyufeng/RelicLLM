"""One layer's attention on the card: the arithmetic, the bounds, the cache, the release.

Everything here is one of two questions. The first is whether the device attention is
the reference's attention, which is answered against `layers.py` rather than against a
second copy of the same idea: the reference is the oracle, and a test that recomputes
what it is testing only tests its own arithmetic. The synthetic half runs without the
checkpoint and covers the places where two readings of the model differ -- the sink as
a column against the sink as a bias, the window against the prefix, the folded query
groups against `repeat_kv` -- because those are silent: every one of them produces a
tensor of the right shape and a plausible number.

The second question is whether the cache is a cache. A ring that wraps has to return
the *last* window in time order, a decode step has to read back what a prefill stored,
and a chunked prefill has to agree with a one-shot one -- to the rounding of its own
summations, since the gemms are not the same shape, but to nothing else. The regression
that motivates the last test in the file is worth naming because no single-call
comparison can see it: the online softmax's running maximum once aliased a one-query
sink, so a call wrote into the layer's own parameter and the *next* call was wrong.

    stack splits the attention four ways, so a global layer has one key head and the fold's batch
    is a batch and not a broadcast.

    The kernel is cleared in both arms on purpose. With it in, the arm below `FOLD_KEYS` is the
    kernel's and is held to a bound, not an equality -- that file is
    `test_models_mimo_v2_decode_attention_kernel.py`, and this test is about the fold.

    A windowed layer's span is its ring, so the two paths are the same 128 keys -- but they are not
    the same *sum*: the chunk path's `single_pass_attention` folds the span and the sink into one
    reduction while `decode_output` sums the span, adds the sink's exponential, and only then
    divides. Past the ring's wrap that lands on a bfloat16 boundary on about a tenth of the rows.

    The measurement is the counterfactual that names the cause: with the sink taken out of the
    picture -- `-inf` contributes `exp(-inf - max)`, which is exactly zero -- the two paths are
    `torch.equal` over the same walk. So the difference is the sink's and not the span's, which is
    why `decode_foldable` keeps a family that carries one on the path it was measured on. The

    `MimoV2DeviceAttention.decode_output` exists because a decode step is 48 of a token's calls and
    the chunk path pays for a visibility mask and a set of rope broadcast axes that one row has no
    use for: the mask is a slice, because `upper` is `keys - 1` for a single query, and the rope's
    axes are an `unsqueeze` that a `[heads, head_dim]` tensor does not need. Dropping both is exact
    -- `exp(-inf - max)` is zero, and the row maximum over the masked block is the row maximum over
    the visible one -- and *exact* is the claim this test holds it to: not a tolerance, equality.

    Both families run because both have a case the other does not. A windowed layer wraps its
    128-slot ring at step 128 and reads a `prefix`-and-`cat` span from then on, and its `lower` is
    the clamp rather than the zero; the global layer never wraps at this length and its whole span
    is visible. And the windowed layer is the one that carries a sink, which is the softmax's one
    extra term.

    The steps go past the ring on purpose, and past `FOLD_KEYS` never -- which for these two layers
    is the same thing, because the windowed one's span is its ring and the global one's is 136
