"""The bridge that lets a Python runtime be the engine behind the C++ scheduler.

Two halves, tested apart. [`RuntimeRun`] is the handshake between a whole-generation loop and a
scheduler that wants one token per call, and it is plain Python, so it is tested against a fake
loop here rather than against a model. `RuntimeEngine` is tested against a fake native module,
because what it does with the binding -- which fields it writes back, what it refuses -- is the
part that can go wrong independently of whether an extension was built.

`tests/test_python_engine_binding.py` is the other end: a real `BatchScheduler` driving a real
`RuntimeEngine`.
