"""What a decode step actually costs, with nothing in the loop that measures it.

Every other probe in this directory wraps something: a region in a `perf_counter` pair, a phase in a
CUDA event pair, an op in the profiler's tables. On a step whose host is the larger half, the
instrument is inside the number it reports -- `probe_mimo_v2_host_phases.py` puts a clock around
every one of a token's regions and reads 118.3 ms at 4096 where the same configuration, the same
sixteen resident rows and the same depth read **107.3, 97.3 and 96.5** with nothing wrapped. So this
probe is the number the others are checked against, and it is deliberately the simplest thing here:
`--steps` calls to `model.step`, one `perf_counter` pair around the whole loop, one `synchronize`
after it.

Two of the numbers it prints are not on the clock and are the reason it is worth having on its own:

* **How many experts a step staged and how many of its draws the resident set answered.** The copy
  is the floor under a step that no host work hides -- 47 layers of the `sorted` deal's two experts
  is 1198.5 MiB a rank -- so a run whose hit rate is not the one a table was taken at is a different
  step, and residency is worth more than every kernel on this path put together.
* **The four ranks' own steps.** A step is a chain of barriers, so the slowest rank is the step.
  The spread is printed because a rank that is behind is a configuration problem -- the deal, the
  resident set, the host -- and a rate quoted from rank 0 alone would hide it.

A step at a depth needs a prefix, and **the prefix has to be a real one**. The obvious way to reach a
depth is `bench_mimo_v2_model.fill_cache`, which writes the positions without running the model and
turns a 262144-position step into seconds instead of the 1 h 47 m this page's prefill rate would
charge. What it does not give is a step a serving loop would take: the states are random, so the
router's draw is nearly the same experts over and over, the resident set answers almost all of them,
and the step comes out *cheaper* than the same step over a prompt -- 96.5 ms at eight positions
against 117.8 over a real eight-token prompt, at the same sixteen rows. A rate read off a filled
cache is therefore an upper bound and not the token.

So `--depth` prefills `--tokens` of a real document through `model.prefill` in `--chunk`-wide
chunks, which is a real context and costs what a real context costs: 4096 tokens is about half a
minute. `--fill` is the escape hatch for the depths where that is not affordable -- 262144 is 42
minutes of prefill against 5.65 GiB of cache -- and a run that uses it says so in its own line.

Usage:

    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 tests/probe_mimo_v2_decode_token.py --steps 200
    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 tests/probe_mimo_v2_decode_token.py --depth 4096 --resident-rows 16
    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 tests/probe_mimo_v2_decode_token.py --depth 262144 --fill \
        --resident-rows 8 --steps 120

The checkpoint is the default asset path; without it the script exits 0 and says so.
