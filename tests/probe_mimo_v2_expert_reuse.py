"""How much of a decode step's expert copy a rank has already staged once before.

A decode step at 262144 costs 204.7 ms, and `probe_mimo_v2_decode_phases.py` says what is in it:
**the copy stall is 99.9 of it** -- the part of the expert H2D the kernel actually waited for -- and
nothing else is close (attention 45.3, kernel 12.5, collective ~10, router ~8, rest ~28). The bytes
are the draw's minimum: two experts a rank a layer, 25.5 MiB, 1198.5 MiB a token, and the link is at
12 GiB/s already.

They are also *unhideable as the step is scheduled*, and that is a dependency and not a mistake in the
slot code. Layer L's draw needs layer L's attention, so the copy cannot be issued before the attention
it would have to hide behind; and the host's `indices.tolist()` drains the stream at that point, so
the device has no other work in flight either. The one thing a rank does know early is what it staged
for the *previous token* -- same layer, same rank, the same two rows of the same arena -- so the
question this probe answers is whether that is a prediction worth acting on.

What it measures, on a real prompt and a real greedy continuation, four ranks: for every layer and
every step, how many of the rank's `ceil(top_k / world)` rows hold the same expert as the step before.
The accounting is per *position* rather than per set, because a position that holds the same expert
needs no copy at all -- its row is already right -- while a set that matches in a different order
would need the rows rewritten. The row a slot's expert lands in is `sorted`'s and is stable across
steps (row `i` is the rank's sorted slot `rank + i * world`); under `id` a rank's rows are its own
experts in draw order, so a draw that hands it three shifts every row after the first and the
position-wise question is not the one to ask there.

**The answer is no.** On 8192 tokens of a real document and 32 greedy steps, a row holds the expert
it held a step earlier 9 to 13.5 times in a hundred (0.18 to 0.27 of a rank's two, 76 to 84% of the
pairs keeping neither row) and a rank's whole set repeats in 1.9 to 2.4% of the draws -- three to four
times the ~3% a re-draw would score on its own, and far too little to issue a copy from. The design a
better number would have justified: a prefetch of layer L+1's rows on the copy stream when layer L's
draw is read, landing behind layer L's kernel and layer L+1's attention, and at layer L+1's own draw a
copy only of the positions that moved. A hit would then cost no copy at all and the floor would be
the copy's *unpredicted* fraction rather than all of it. This router's draws are too scattered for
that fraction to be small -- which is also why a wider batch does not help: a chunk's tokens draw
nearly disjoint experts, so staging them together is one copy either way.
