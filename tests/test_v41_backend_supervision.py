"""The V4.1 adapter joins the factory's supervised tensor-parallel path.

The adapter loads its checkpoint from rank 0's own process, so the supervisor cannot
hand rank 0 a command the way it hands one to ranks 1..N-1: rank 0 is built here, and
the rendezvous it needs -- the file path for the NCCL id and the TCP address for the
process group -- has to be in *this* process's environment for exactly as long as the
load takes.  These tests pin that contract, and pin that it is not left behind
afterwards, which is what makes a second engine in the same process hang.
