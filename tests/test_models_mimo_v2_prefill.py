"""A chunk of tokens through the routed experts: the prefill path, and what it has to agree with.

`forward` is one token and `forward_chunk` is a chunk, and the difference is not the batch -- the
kernel has always been batched -- but the layout. A decode step's draw is eight experts out of a
quarter of them, so the arena holds the draw and the kernel reads one row a drawing. A chunk draws
nearly every expert there is, so what a rank computes is the *subset of the chunk's pairs whose
expert it owns*, and the kernel wants those pairs grouped by expert with an arena row a group. Two
things follow and both are checked here: the layout is a gather, a stable sort and a `searchsorted`,
which is easy to get right in a way that is silently wrong about *which* pair a weight belongs to;
and the chunk path is a different kernel from the single-token one, so "the same arithmetic" is a
claim with a measured number behind it rather than an identity.

The number is this: the two kernels agree to about 1e-7 of the answer's own peak, not exactly,
because the grouped kernel tiles K in two stages of shared memory where the single-token one tiles
it in one, and reduces a token's pairs in a separate pass. The miniature here has a peak of 2.1e3
-- its experts are random codes at scale one, so their outputs are large -- and the two paths differ
by 1.2e-4 on that, which is 6e-8 relative. Every comparison in this file is against that peak and
not against an absolute tolerance, because the same kernel on the released checkpoint's experts
produces a stream of a very different size.

The other half of the file is the model: `mlp` dispatches on the row count, `prefill` runs a prompt
in chunks of the caller's width, and a chunked prompt has to produce the same tokens as a prompt fed
one token at a time. That last one is the end-to-end claim, and it is checked both on the miniature
and on two released layers -- the miniature's experts are random, so only the release can say the
chunk path is right about real weights.

def test_the_released_two_layers_prefill_as_one_token_at_a_time():
    """Two released layers, a chunk of three tokens against three single-token calls.

    The miniature's experts are random codes, so it can show that the layout is the layout but
    not that the chunk path reads real fp4 weights the way the release means them. Layer 0 is
    the dense layer and layer 1 is the routed one, so this is one real MoE layer fed a chunk,
    out of the checkpoint's own mapped pages rather than the 149.81 GiB bank -- which is why
    the band is one expert wide: a rank's whole share is 256 experts, and only the bands a
    drawing lands in are staged, so this reads about fifty experts and not all of them.

    What can differ between the two paths is the attention's summation order, which changes
    when a row is computed in a chunk instead of alone, and the expert kernel's, which changes
    between the single-token and grouped kernels. Both are the same layer stack otherwise, so
    the disagreement is a rounding and not a different model: measured, it is 3.0e-7 of the
    logits' own peak of 17.45, three hundred times inside the bound below, and the two paths
    take the same token at every one of the six positions.
