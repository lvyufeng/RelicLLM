"""Semantic-contract tests for the ops `src/models/deepseek_v4_1/kernels.py` exposes.

These ops have no oracle on this host. The released V4.1 runtime implements them in TileLang, which
is not installed and cannot be (it needs `torch>=2.10.0`; this environment is on 2.9.1), and the
sm_75 cards here have no FP4 tensor core. So nothing below compares against the reference's own
output, and no test here claims to.

What is checked is that each op behaves the way the V4.1 reference says it must:

* `sparse_attn` against a brute-force softmax written out longhand in the test, plus the empty-index
  case the reference's finite-floor comment exists for. That comment is the reason this file is not
  merely re-testing `src/kernels/ops.py`: the reference changed its score fill from `-inf` to `-1e30`
  for V4.1, explicitly so that a row whose every index is `-1` yields zeros instead of NaN. The
  implementation here satisfies that, but nothing in `src/kernels/ops.py` says it has to, and a
  rewrite to a plain `-inf` fill would still pass every V4-Flash test.
* `hc_split_sinkhorn` against the reference's *stated* sequence of normalizations, traced step by
  step rather than read off the implementation, so a reordering of the row and column steps fails.
  It also pins the two asymmetric gates (`pre` has an epsilon floor, `post` is doubled), which the
  identical output shapes hide.
* `fp4_act_quant_e4m3`'s scale, which is the one op here that `src/kernels/ops.py` does not have.
  The scale is `e4m3(amax / 6)` and not `e4m3(amax)`, and the amax floor is high enough that an
  all-zero block still gets a nonzero scale.

Every assertion is on values computed here, so a pass means these ops agree with the reference's
documented arithmetic and nothing more. Whether a V4.1 forward pass built on them produces the
right tokens is not measurable on this host; see the V4.1 model page for that limitation.
