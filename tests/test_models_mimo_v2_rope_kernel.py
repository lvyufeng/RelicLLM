"""The decode step's rotation in one kernel: the reference's bits, and where it is reached.

`device_attention.rope_rows` is `apply_partial_rope` with the head and sequence axes folded away,
and a decode step calls it thirty-two times a token -- the query and the key of every one of the
forty-eight layers. It is eight tensor operations, so it is cheap in flops and expensive on the
host: 123.8 us a call on this box against a dispatch at about five, which is 11.9 ms of a token's
host time for a split, a half swap, two multiplies and an add.

`mimo_rope_rows` is those operations as one kernel, and the point of the file is that it is the
*same* operations. Two things about the reference make that easy to get wrong and are the reason
this test is `torch.equal` rather than `allclose`:

* The products round separately. The row is bfloat16 and the cosine is float32, so `rope * cos`
  rounds once in float32 and the addition rounds again. A kernel that contracts the pair into an
  fma -- which `--use_fast_math` is free to do and this translation unit is compiled with -- lands
  on a different last bit for a large fraction of rows.
* The half swap is a sign flip, not a subtraction. `rotated` is `cat(-x2, x1)`, so the first half
  of the sum is `p1 + (-p2)` and not `fma(-x2, sin, p1)`.

Neither is visible from a tolerance. So the suite runs the released geometry, both dtypes the
checkpoint's families actually carry, and a set of shapes the release does not have, and asks for
equality on every one of them.

The second half of the file is the dispatch: `MimoV2DeviceAttention.rotate` has to reach the
kernel when the extension is built and `rope_rows` when it is not, and the full decode step has to
be unchanged between the two.
