"""What `--enable-batching` and `--max-batch-size` mean on the cpp backend.

The two flags are the same decision seen twice: a width above 1 is a request for a scheduler, and
the scheduler is what makes the width mean anything. Before this, batching existed only as
`--backend-option enable_batching=true` -- a spelling no operator types -- while `--max-batch-size`
was accepted by the CLI, put into `EngineArgs`, and read by nothing on this backend. A flag that is
parsed and ignored is the failure mode these tests are about, so each one names the observable
consequence rather than the field.

These are hermetic: the native module is a fake that records how it was constructed, so the width the
engine would have been given is asserted directly and no checkpoint, card or extension is needed.
The engine sizes its KV cache from that width, so it is not a cosmetic number.
