"""The flags the option declarations generate, and the refusal for one nothing reads.

U2b-2 of #447. `tests/test_declared_options.py` holds each runtime's declarations to its ``_Options``
dataclass; this is the other end of the same statement -- the command line built from those
declarations -- and the two failures it exists for are the ones a flat namespace brings:

* **a flag that is not the declaration's name**, which is how a merge turns back into two flags;
* **a flag the selected runtime does not read**, which is a tuning option that silently does
  nothing, and the reason one namespace is safe at all.

The parser is the real one. There is no second list of flags here to keep in step with it: the tests
read ``build_parser()``'s own actions, so a flag added by hand shows up as a declaration nothing
generated and a generated flag shows up against the declaration it came from.
