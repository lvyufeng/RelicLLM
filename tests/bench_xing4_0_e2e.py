"""One-card prefill and decode rates for Xing4.0-29B-A4B, on real text.

The prompt is real prose out of this repository's own documentation, repeated to
the length being measured and then tokenized -- not random ids and not synthetic
tensors.  That matters here more than usual: the routed MoE's draws are a
function of the activations, so a prompt made of noise routes differently from
one made of English and its experts are not the ones a served request would use.

Each length is measured in one process, serially, and the model is loaded once.
The numbers a report wants are prefill tokens a second (the prompt's own pass)
and decode tokens a second (the steps after it), stated at the context they were
taken at -- a decode rate without its prompt length is not a comparable number.

`--decode` picks how a step is taken, and the three arms exist to separate two
changes that a report would otherwise have to state as one:

    eager    the forward as it always ran
    bucket   the same forward, reading the cache at the width a graph would
    graph    a captured step at that width, replayed

`bucket` against `eager` is what the *bucket* costs -- the attention reads at
most twice the rows a step needs, and nothing else about the step moves.
`graph` against `bucket` is what the *recording* buys, and nothing else.  The
capture itself is a one-off and lands in `first step`, which is reported apart
from the steady rate for exactly that reason.
