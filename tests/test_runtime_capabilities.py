"""Where the answer to "can this runtime do X" lives, and the invariants that keep it there.

Capability used to be computed in six ``capabilities()`` methods, the refusal of a checkpoint was
written twice per adapter -- once as a predicate for ``auto`` and once as a raise for an explicit
``--backend`` -- three adapters carried their own copy of the same ignored-options set, and
``supports_prefix_caching`` meant "the store exists" on two runtimes and "the byte budget is
positive" on a third. Every test here pins one of those, and the source scans are deliberate: the
defect was never a wrong value, it was a second place to put one.
