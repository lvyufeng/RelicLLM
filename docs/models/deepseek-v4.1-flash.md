# DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash

A 552B-parameter multimodal mixture-of-experts model with a causal encoder-decoder backbone, a
shared-compressed-KV attention scheme (CSA2) and a 196B-parameter Engram conditional-memory table.
PocketLLM runs the released 475.24 GiB checkpoint over four consumer cards — the dense tree on the
GPUs, the routed experts in a pinned host bank — and serves it through the OpenAI-compatible API.

- **Backend**: `--backend v41` (OpenAI-compatible server, one request at a time)
- **Parallelism**: 4 ranks, one process a card
- **Context**: up to 262,144 tokens
- **Validated on**: 4×RTX 2080 Ti 22 GiB, PCIe Gen3, no NVLink

## Overview

The released checkpoint is 475.24 GiB across 48 shards and 96,085 tensors. 58% of it is routed experts
and 39.8% is two Engram tables, and the four cards hold 88 GiB between them — so the checkpoint does
not fit, and where its parts live is the whole design:

- **The dense tree and the packed FP4 experts execute on the cards.** All four ranks run the 40
  attention blocks, the shared experts, the norms, the embedding and the head, out of a memory-mapped
  checkpoint, in the checkpoint's own FP4 and FP8 formats.
- **The routed experts stay on the host.** A 457.8 GiB bank of them is pinned in host memory and each
  rank stages the rows a layer's routing asks for over PCIe. This is why the runtime needs no
  all-to-all: what crosses back is 20 KiB a card a layer.
- **The Engram tables are read where they lie.** 189.13 GiB of n-gram tables are gathered from the
  shards per lookup, or copied into RAM with `--backend-option resident_engram`.

Requests are served one at a time, but a request that shares a prefix with one already served
forwards only the tail: cross-request prefix caching is on by default.

The model is text-only here. The checkpoint's vision tower is audited and never loaded.

## Run it

### Serve it

```bash
DEEPSEEK_V41_RESIDENT_EXPERTS=1 python -m pocketllm serve \
  --model /path/to/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash \
  --backend v41 \
  --tensor-parallel-size 4 \
  --max-model-len 32768 \
  --port 8000 \
  --backend-option expert_pool_rows=148 \
  --backend-option prefill_chunk=4096 \
  --backend-option decode_graphs=true \
  --backend-option threads=22
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "v41", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}], "stream": true}'
```

The CLI's own supervisor starts one process a rank — rank 0 binds the listener, ranks 1–3 are NCCL
workers — and all four must report ready before the server answers. Startup is not quick: with
`DEEPSEEK_V41_RESIDENT_EXPERTS=1` each rank pins its share of the 457.8 GiB bank, about 100 s a rank,
and the 48 shards load in another 130 s. `--max-model-len 262144` is the longest context the runtime
accepts.

The endpoint serves `/health`, `/ready`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/completions`, SSE
streaming and `/metrics`. A response reports how much of its prompt was reused, the way OpenAI does,
as `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`.

### Serving options

| Option | Default | What it does |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `expert_pool_rows` | 288 | Expert rows a chunk's arena holds, per rank. An arena the pass re-draws; worth 8.44× on a 512-token prefill against its own off state, and 1.305× on a decode. **148 is not optional at 262144**, which is what the long-context numbers above are taken at; 0 is the control column, and it turns the batched prefill off with it. |
| `prefill_chunk` | — | Tokens a prefill call takes at once. The width is the prefill knob, and 4096 is the width the long-context numbers need. |
| `decode_graphs` | `false` | Capture a decode step as a CUDA graph. |
| `threads` | — | Host threads a rank's CPU work uses. 22 is one NUMA node on this box. |
| `prefix_cache_bytes` | `4g` | Prefix-cache budget, a rank. `0` is what the CLI's `--enable-prefix-caching` off spells; a `k`/`m`/`g` suffix is accepted. |
| `prefix_cache_head_tokens` | 1024 | The head anchor a snapshot is taken at. |
| `expert_deal` | `id` | How the four cards share a row's experts. `id` balances the bytes a chunk's expert H2D moves — 1.49× / 1.42× on prefill at 32768 / 262144 against `sorted`, which is the opt-in alternative. |
| `expert_buffers` | 2 | Expert arenas the pipeline keeps in flight. |
| `resident_engram` | `false` | Copy the two Engram tables into RAM instead of gathering from the shards. 189.13 GiB and roughly 750 s of reading, once. |
| `expert_device` / `expert_world` | resolved per run | Where the routed experts execute, in the loader's convention: at TP>1 this resolves to the cards (`cuda:0` plus the rank) and `expert_world` to the world size; a single-process run keeps the experts where the dense tree is unless told otherwise. |
| `--enable-batching` | off | Serves requests through the shared `BatchScheduler` instead of this adapter's own serialized session. See below. |
| `scheduler_timeout_ms` | 600000 | How long a submitted request waits for its result before failing. A backstop against a wedged request, not a deadline. |

### Through the shared scheduler

`--enable-batching` routes requests through the same `BatchScheduler` the `cpp` backend drives. Off by
default because the scheduler is the C++ library, and this runtime otherwise serves without it.

It is not a claim of concurrency. The runtime declares `max_slots = 1` and
`continuous_batching = False` — one mutable KV state, unchanged — and the scheduler takes the smaller
of the requested width and the declaration, so a `--max-batch-size` above 1 is answered with one
rather than refused. What changes is *whose* request lifecycle it is: admission, slot accounting,
cancellation and the `/metrics` gauges come from the one library the `cpp` backend uses instead of
from a second implementation of them.

Two seams are worth naming, because both are places a second path could quietly stop agreeing with
the first.

`_start_runtime` builds its payload with the serial path's own `_payload`, from the request the
scheduler's row came from rather than from a re-derivation of the fields the scheduler carries. The
scheduler's copy has no `thinking_mode`, and the mode decides how a finished generation is split into
`reasoning_content` and an answer, so a route that rebuilt the request from the transport would
answer differently from the route that did not.

`_result` is still this checkpoint's, through an override of `_batched_result`, so the finished
generation is parsed by the checkpoint's own encoder on both routes rather than being returned as the
decoded text on one of them. One field is not the same on the two: `usage.cached_tokens`, which the
prefix store reports to the serial path and the scheduler has no channel for. The token ids, the
text and the finish reason are.

**Measured on the four-card host.** Two concurrent clients, 16 tokens each, against the released
checkpoint on 4 x RTX 2080 Ti at `--max-model-len 4096`, the resident expert bank attached
(`DEEPSEEK_V41_RESIDENT_EXPERTS=1`), one process per arm:

| Arm | Aggregate | First client | Second client | `requests_running` peak |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--enable-batching` | **2.19 tok/s** (32 tokens in 14.62 s) | 6.97 s | 14.61 s | 1, with 1 waiting |
| `--no-enable-batching` | 1.88 tok/s (32 tokens in 16.98 s) | 7.97 s | 16.97 s | not published |

The scheduler route is 1.17x the serialized one and both clients finish sooner, which is what a
width-1 scheduler should do and not what concurrency would: the first request is admitted at once and
the second waits for the slot, where the serialized path admits both and makes each wait on the
other's lock. The gauges are the evidence that it was the scheduler -- peak `requests_running` 1 and
`requests_waiting` 1 out of two clients, against no series at all on the other arm.

`scripts/bench_cpp_scheduler_metrics.py --backend v41 --tp 4` is the harness. It needs
`--startup-timeout` well above the supervisor's 300 s default: a first run that has to *fill* the
457.8 GiB bank takes about seven minutes, and the supervisor's timeout fires while the fill is still
running and reports the ranks as missing. Filling it once with a long-budget run leaves
`/dev/shm/pocketllm_v41_experts/bank.ready` behind, and every run after that attaches in
milliseconds.

`DEEPSEEK_V41_RESIDENT_EXPERTS=1` is the environment-variable form of the pinned host bank and is what
the command above uses. `DEEPSEEK_V41_INDEXER_ROW_SPLIT=1` is the one knob that reaches the attention's
indexer rather than the experts: it shards that module by query rows instead of by index head, which
removes the indexer's per-key-tile score collective — behind a flag, default off, priced at 0.914× on
a 256K prefill.

### Without a server

```bash
# the whole backbone on the host CPU -- a correctness check, not a benchmark
python -m src.models.deepseek_v4_1.generate \
  --checkpoint /mnt/data3/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash \
  --prompt "The capital of France is" --max-new-tokens 8

# the dense tree cut across the four cards, one process a rank
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 -m src.cli.generate_v41 \
  --checkpoint /mnt/data3/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash \
  --prompt "The capital of France is" --max-new-tokens 8

# the metadata audit, which reads headers only and needs no checkpoint download
python scripts/audit_dsv41_headers.py --checkpoint-dir /path/to/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash --require-complete
```

## What is supported

| Capability | State |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAI-compatible serving (chat, completions, streaming) | Supported |
| Four-rank TP4, one process a card | Supported |
| Dense tree and packed FP4 experts on the cards | Supported |
| 457.8 GiB routed-expert bank pinned in host memory | Supported |
| 262,144-token context | Supported |
| Cross-request prefix caching | Supported, on by default |
| Engram lookup (189.13 GiB of tables) | Read on demand, from the shards or from RAM — there is no GPU consumer of the rows |
| Vision tower and aligner (263 tensors) | **Not implemented** — audited and never loaded; the text path carries no image mask |
| MTP / DSpark (3 draft layers, 7.39 GiB) | Present in the checkpoint, not executed |
| Batching, continuous batching, chunked prefill | **Not implemented** — one request at a time, through this adapter's own session and through the shared `BatchScheduler` alike |
| The shared `BatchScheduler` (`--enable-batching`) | Supported at the width this runtime declares, which is 1. Same lifecycle and same gauges as the `cpp` backend, same answers as the serialized path |
| Numeric parity with the released reference | **Unclaimed** — the reference stack needs `torch>=2.10.0` and `tilelang==0.1.8`, neither available here |

## Performance

Four ranks, one process a card, a real checkpoint, one request at a time. Every figure is a served
number over `pocketllm serve --backend v41`, 64 greedy tokens a leg.

| | Prefill | Decode | Step |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 260,244-token prompt | **150.3–152.0 tok/s** | **3.48–3.54 tok/s** | 253–262 ms |
| 1,364-token prompt | **137.5–140.8 tok/s** | **4.45–4.53 tok/s** | — |
| 1,364-token prompt, first request | 108.0 tok/s | — | — |

The long prompt is the *faster* prefill of the two, because a short one is dominated by fixed
per-process cost, and the first request on a fresh server is the slowest because it pays the capture
pass. Decode is the half that does not travel with prompt length at the same rate — the same service
reads 4.45–4.53 tok/s at 1,364 prompt tokens.

Two contrast rows, both from the same four cards and neither a served path. On the host CPU alone a
generated token costs **15 to 42 s**, and 99.7% of it is turning the fp4 expert codes into bf16
numbers rather than reading them. With the routed experts on the cards and the dense tree still on the
host, a step is **1.06–1.14 s**; with the dense tree cut across the cards as well, **722–747 ms**,
which is what `torchrun -m src.cli.generate_v41` does.

## Hardware and memory

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Cards | 4, one process each, TP4. Nothing here needs NVLink. |
| Card memory | The dense tree, the packed FP4 expert working set and the KV cache; the routed experts are not resident |
| Host memory | **457.8 GiB** pinned for the expert bank with `DEEPSEEK_V41_RESIDENT_EXPERTS=1`, plus 189.13 GiB more if `resident_engram` is set |
| Storage | The checkpoint's 48 safetensors shards, 475.24 GiB, memory-mapped and read on demand |
| Startup | ~100 s a rank to pin the bank, ~130 s to load the shards |

Memory, not kernels, is the structural problem: 58.0% of the checkpoint is routed experts and 39.8%
is two Engram tables, and a 4×22 GiB deployment can hold neither. Any V4.1 plan has to place experts
and Engram in host memory or on disk before kernel work matters.

## Known limitations

- **One request at a time, and there is no batched path.** `--backend v41` takes a single request lock
  and reports `supports_batch=False`: no continuous batching, no chunked prefill, no paged KV pool.
  Prefix caching changes what a request costs, not how many run at once.
- **No MTP and no speculative decoding.** The three DSpark draft layers are 7.39 GiB the loader
  deliberately leaves in the shards.
- **No numeric oracle.** The released reference needs `torch>=2.10.0` and `tilelang==0.1.8` and this
  host has neither, and its sm_75 cards have no FP4 tensor core for the reference's own fallbacks. The
  acceptance evidence is generated text — greedy decode returns `' Paris'` and then `'.'` for `"The
  capital of France is"` on every path — not a logit comparison.
- **Engram is addressable and gathered, but not measured against the reference.** The hash front end
  reproduces both declared row counts exactly to the row and the rows are read on demand; what is open
  is the gate and value projections' parity with the reference, and the fact that gathering from the
  shards is not a viable steady state — a cold 512-token prefill's gathers measure 253.4 s against
  0.009 s once the table is resident.
- **Vision is unvalidated in both directions.** 263 tensors are accounted for and shape-checked; no
  image has been processed.
- **The audit validates metadata consistency, not correctness.** A checkpoint could satisfy all 39
  checks and still be unusable, and a value that is *consistently* wrong in both the config and the
  shapes would pass.
- **The two config layouts are not interchangeable field for field.** A consumer handed only
  `inference/config.json` has no token ids, no `topk_method` and no `param_dtype`, and its top-level
  `dtype` is the *quantization* dtype rather than the storage one.
