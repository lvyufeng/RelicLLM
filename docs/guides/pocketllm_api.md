# PocketLLM API and Backend Guide

PocketLLM presents one user-facing API over its runtimes:

- **`torch`** is the host-PyTorch runtime, selected by `auto` for a DeepSeek-V4 checkpoint.
- **`v41`**, **`mimo`**, **`xing4`** and **`qwen4_exp`** are the per-architecture PyTorch runtimes.

There used to be a second execution plane, a native **C++** `cpp_engine` reached by `--backend cpp`.
It has been retired: this repository builds no C/C++ extension, `cpp` is not an accepted
`--backend`, and the engine lives in the archived
[relic-engine](https://github.com/lvyufeng/relic-engine). Every runtime here is PyTorch.

The common API does not imply shared kernels, KV-cache layouts, or schedulers. Those remain runtime- and hardware-specific so that Turing CUDA and Ascend optimizations are not weakened by a lowest-common-denominator abstraction.

## Offline API

```python
from pocketllm import EngineArgs, LLM, SamplingParams

llm = LLM(EngineArgs(
    model="/path/to/checkpoint",
    backend="auto",  # or "torch" / "v41" / "mimo" / "xing4" / "qwen4_exp"
    tensor_parallel_size=4,
    max_model_len=65536,
))

outputs = llm.generate(
    ["Explain speculative decoding.", "Explain continuous batching."],
    SamplingParams(max_tokens=128, temperature=0.0),
)
for output in outputs:
    print(output.text, output.usage.as_dict())
```

Pre-tokenized input is also accepted:

```python
outputs = llm.generate([[1, 42, 17]], SamplingParams(max_tokens=16))
```

For chat-shaped inputs, use the library-first chat surface. It accepts the same normalized message
and optional fields as `/v1/chat/completions`, and returns the same list-shaped result as
`generate()` (one result for the supplied conversation):

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "Answer concisely."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is 2+2?"},
]
outputs = llm.chat(
    messages,
    SamplingParams(max_tokens=32, temperature=0.0),
    reasoning_effort="low",
)
print(outputs[0].text)
```

`chat()` also accepts `reasoning`, `tools`, `tool_choice`, `response_format`, and an optional
`request_id`. The request body is normalized through the same backend-neutral builder used by the
HTTP endpoint; checkpoint-owned chat templates remain the authority for model-specific prompt
encoding. Caller-owned message and tool structures are not mutated.

Use `generate_stream()` or `chat_stream()` for token events and `cancel(request_id)` to request
cancellation at a safe generation boundary. Every runtime here is serialized — one request at a time
— and unsupported sampling or request features report `UnsupportedFeatureError` rather than being
silently ignored. Streaming decodes the cumulative token sequence before emitting each delta, so BPE
and UTF-8 token boundaries are handled by the tokenizer.

## Async API

`AsyncLLM` mirrors every offline entry point: `generate`, `generate_stream`, `chat`, and
`chat_stream`.

```python
from pocketllm import AsyncLLM, EngineArgs, SamplingParams

async with AsyncLLM(EngineArgs(model="/path/to/checkpoint")) as llm:
    result = (await llm.generate("Hello", SamplingParams(max_tokens=32)))[0]
    async for event in llm.generate_stream("Stream this"):
        print(event.text, end="", flush=True)

    chat_result = (await llm.chat(
        [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain KV caching."}],
        SamplingParams(max_tokens=32),
    ))[0]
    print(chat_result.text)
    async for event in llm.chat_stream(
        [{"role": "user", "content": "Stream a short answer."}],
    ):
        print(event.text, end="", flush=True)
```

`AsyncLLM` currently provides non-blocking application integration around the backend contract. Its
own concurrency is the executor's `max_workers`, which defaults to 1, so it adds no batching of its
own; the batch path belongs to the backend under it and is a separate decision. The async chat
methods reuse the same executor-backed lifecycle and `TokenEvent` contract as the sync facade.

## CLI and server

```bash
# Installed console script
pocketllm serve \
  --model /path/to/checkpoint \
  --backend auto \
  --tensor-parallel-size 4 \
  --max-model-len 65536 \
  --port 8000

# Source-tree equivalent
python -m pocketllm serve \
  --model /path/to/checkpoint \
  --backend auto \
  --tensor-parallel-size 4 \
  --max-model-len 65536 \
  --port 8000

# DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash, TP4, one request at a time
python -m pocketllm serve \
  --model /mnt/data3/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash \
  --backend v41 \
  --tensor-parallel-size 4 \
  --max-model-len 2048 \
  --port 8000 \
  --expert-pool-rows 288 \
  --prefill-chunk-tokens 4096 \
  --decode-graphs \
  --threads 22
``` 

For `tensor_parallel_size > 1`, the CLI supervises local tensor-parallel ranks by default. It creates a
private per-run rendezvous directory and NCCL-ID path, assigns `RANK`/`LOCAL_RANK`/`WORLD_SIZE` and
`TP_RANK`/`TP_WORLD`, starts every rank without a shell, and waits for all ranks to finish loading
before rank 0 is considered ready. Only rank 0 binds the HTTP listener. A rank failure, startup
timeout, or received `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` causes the supervisor to stop and reap the whole group.
Use `--tensor-parallel-startup-timeout SECONDS` and `--tensor-parallel-shutdown-timeout SECONDS`
to tune lifecycle bounds; `--tensor-parallel-master-addr`, `--tensor-parallel-master-port`, and
`--tensor-parallel-rendezvous-dir` are available for deployments that need explicit rendezvous
placement. A caller-provided rendezvous directory is treated as a parent for a fresh private run
directory and is never removed by PocketLLM.

The built-in supervisor works with every adapter that serves a checkpoint: each enters its own
worker loop through `RankedWorker`, `warmup_tp` brings the NCCL communicator up inside construction,
the NCCL-ID path arrives through the environment the supervisor publishes, and each rank's card is
its own index — which works precisely because the supervisor hands every rank the same visible
device list rather than narrowing it per rank. A V4.1 backend is the case that shaped the rest:
rank 0 loads inside the rendezvous window, because a backend handed back unloaded would find the
group gone.
A rank it starts runs **one program**, `pocketllm/backends/worker.py`, whichever runtime it is
serving: what tells it which one is `POCKETLLM_WORKER_BACKEND`, set from the `WORKERS` registry, and
the two things that still differ per runtime are the adapter to import and whether the checkpoint is
already loaded when the adapter is constructed. Adding a runtime therefore means adding a
`WorkerSpec` entry rather than writing a second worker script.
`--no-tensor-parallel-supervisor` remains supported for `torchrun` and hand-written rank launchers,
and is the opt-out for a rank layout this supervisor does not produce. A per-rank
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is a layout it does produce — and is still honoured — but it is no longer the
way to name cards: `--device-ids 2,3` names every rank's card once. This process supervisor is not a
scheduler: it starts ranks and reaps them, and what runs inside those ranks is the backend's own
business. So `--tensor-parallel-size 4` says nothing about the width a request sees.

### Batching

No runtime in this repository owns a batch path. `--max-batch-size` and `--enable-batching` are still
accepted on the command line, but a launch that asks for a batch — a width above 1, or
`--enable-batching` on — is refused by name through the factory's capability check rather than
silently served at width 1. The native `BatchScheduler` went with the retired `cpp` backend and is
not available here. `--enable-batching` defaults to unset, so leaving it alone is not a request for
anything.

**A width is a request for a scheduler.** `--max-batch-size 4` asks for one on its own, and
`--no-enable-batching` cannot be combined with it: the contradiction is a `ConfigurationError`
raised at parse time, before the refusals above, rather than a silently-ignored flag.

**The width's cost was measured on the retired scheduler, and the record is kept as its.** That
scheduler ran the width's rows whether or not that many requests were present, so a single request
paid for the width it was given: with the prompt cache held fixed, ~17% more wall than the serialized
session at width 2 and ~18% at width 8, of which about ten points was decode, and its prefill path
did not consult the prefix cache. What the width bought was concurrency: two concurrent requests
reached 30.6 aggregate tok/s through the default path against 25.6 through the serialized one. The
figures and the method behind them are in
[the concurrency acceptance page](https://github.com/lvyufeng/relic-engine/blob/master/docs/performance/cpp_openai_concurrency_validation.md#what-the-width-costs-a-lone-request).
No runtime here can reproduce them, because none has a batch path to reproduce them on.

### Backend options

Every option a runtime accepts is *declared* by that runtime — its type, its default, its bounds and
its accepted values — next to the code that reads it. `pocketllm/backends/options.py` is the single
reader and each adapter's `OPTIONS` is the single list, so the things a launch can get wrong are
answered by one statement rather than by three that can disagree.

**Each declaration is also a flag.** `python -m pocketllm serve --help` lists them, one flag per
option, under the section the declaration names — `--expert-pool-rows` beside `--chunk-rows` under
*Expert arena*, `--prefix-cache-bytes` and `--prefix-cache-head-tokens` under *Prefix cache*. The
help line says who reads the flag (`v41 only`, `v41 and mimo`) and what each of them answers when
nobody names it, because one parser holds every runtime's flags and `--backend` may still be `auto`
when it is parsed. The `--backend-option KEY=VALUE` spelling stays and is the more specific of the
two — it wins over the flag — which is what makes it the escape hatch for a key with no flag and the
long form of one that has.

| What a launch did | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Named a flag the selected runtime does not read | `ConfigurationError` naming the flag and who does read it: the flags are on one command line, and a tuning option that silently does nothing is how a run ends up measured on the wrong lever. |
| Named a key the runtime does not declare | `ConfigurationError` naming the key and listing the ones it does. |
| Gave a value the declared type cannot read | `ConfigurationError` naming the key: `prefill_chunk` is a whole number, `prefix_cache_bytes` takes a `k`/`m`/`g` suffix, `pin` is a flag and reads `true`/`yes`/`on` and their negatives as well as a JSON boolean. |
| Named one option twice, once by an older spelling | `ConfigurationError`. `chunk_rows`/`expert_rows` and `expert_deal`/`deal` are each one option under two names, and which of the two was meant is not knowable from the values. |

A concept more than one runtime reads is declared once
(`pocketllm/backends/shared_options.py`): `prefill_chunk`, `prefix_cache_bytes`,
`prefix_cache_head_tokens` and `expert_deal`. Each runtime references that declaration and states
only what it answers for itself — its own default, its own way of resolving an unset value — so the
flag means one thing wherever it is read, and `--help` prints the answers side by side
(`when unset: 4g on v41 and mimo; 2g on xing4`). One declaration is spelled by a host flag instead
of a generated one: `prefill_chunk` is `--prefill-chunk-tokens`, which the native engine reads by
that name.

`device` used to be declared here too, and it is not an option any more. One name did two jobs — the
platform on the top level, a card on each of the three runtimes, read three different ways — so it
split: **`--device auto|cuda|ascend|cpu`** is the platform and **`--device-ids 2,3`** is the cards,
both on the host beside `--tensor-parallel-size`, because a card list that means the same thing on
every runtime is a fact about the launch. Rank *r* takes the r-th entry, which is the pair
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$rank` + `--device 0` written once for the whole world; unset keeps that pair
working. The old spelling — `--device cuda:2`, `--device 0`, `--backend-option device=...` — is
refused by name, with `--device-ids` in the message. See
[the migration note](../migration/device-splits-into-platform-and-cards.md).

The keys the CLI fills in on every launch — `engine_kind`, `routed_experts_device`, `pd_mode`, and
`nccl_id_path` for a sharded one — are accepted by every runtime and read by none of the model
option parsers, so one launch command line works for every backend.

The unified server provides:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /alive`
- `GET /ready`
- `GET /metrics`
- `GET /v1/models`
- `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- `POST /v1/completions`
- `DELETE /v1/requests/<request_id>`

`/ready` returns HTTP 503 while model loading is incomplete. `/metrics` uses dependency-free Prometheus text exposition and can later be wrapped by a richer exporter.

### Backend-owned series

The histograms above are request-scoped and reach `/metrics` through the HTTP layer. Numbers a
runtime holds *between* requests travel the other channel: `BackendBase.metrics()` returns a flat
`name -> value` mapping, and the server exports whatever it is handed.

The series that exists today is the prefix store's, published with fixed names rather than per
adapter, so a dashboard can compare two runtimes whose names were not typed twice:

| Series | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `relicllm_prefix_cache_hits_total` | Cumulative prefix resumes. |
| `relicllm_prefix_cache_misses_total` | Cumulative prompts that found nothing to resume. |
| `relicllm_prefix_cache_reused_tokens_total` | Tokens served from a resume rather than forwarded. |
| `relicllm_prefix_cache_entries` | Live entries in the store. |
| `relicllm_prefix_cache_bytes` | Bytes the store holds. |
| `relicllm_prefix_cache_budget_bytes` | The byte budget it is allowed. |

A runtime with no prefix store publishes nothing, which the server reads as "no backend-owned
series" rather than as zero — an absent series cannot be mistaken for a measurement, where a zero
would read as a store that is present and empty.

The native `BatchScheduler` admission gauges (`requests_running`, `slots_free`, …) went with the
retired `cpp` backend and the native scheduler library. No runtime here owns a batch path, so no
runtime exports them.

That list is the whole HTTP surface. **`/v1/embeddings` is deliberately unsupported** — PocketLLM
serves the checkpoint's text-generation path, and nothing in either plane computes a pooled
embedding, so there is no head to return, no `/v1/moderations`, `/v1/audio`, or `/v1/images` either.
An unregistered path answers 404 rather than accepting a request it would have to reinterpret.
Callers that need embeddings should run an embedding model; adding a pooling head to this engine is
a separate project from serving generation.

## Request fields

A request field is accepted only when the server acts on it. Every documented OpenAI request field
therefore falls into one of three groups, and a field in the second group has to be removed rather
than trusted.

**Which runtime acts on what.** Whether a field's *value* has a shape this server can read is one
policy for every runtime and is checked before dispatch. Whether a runtime's answer applies the field
at all depends on the runtime, and is declared per runtime through `BackendBase.audit_request`, one
entry per field, from the runtime table (`relicllm/backends/capabilities.py`) that `/v1/models`
already publishes.

Every runtime declares one: the declaration is a `ServedFields` on the runtime's own row, read by
`capabilities.declared_capabilities` for what `/v1/models` publishes and by the adapter's
`audit_request` for what a request is refused on, so the two cannot disagree. A backend that declares
nothing at all still returns `None`, which is what keeps a test double accepted rather than refused
wholesale. Which entry is which runtime's is
[the native surface decision](../architecture/native_surface_decision.md).

The fields the retired engine served (`stop`, `n`, `logprobs`, `response_format`, `thinking_mode`,
`add_generation_prompt`) each ended up somewhere different, and the three worth singling out are the
ones where "accepted" and "applied" are different words:

- **`n` is the host's dispatch.** A request for `n` choices is `n` requests to the runtime, built by
  `pocketllm/choices.py` and run by whichever entry point received the request — the HTTP server or
  `LLM.chat`. One implementation for every runtime, which is why it is not in an adapter. The one
  `n` still refused is a stochastic request against an engine that samples at engine-wide values: the
  choices differ only in the seed they are handed, and that engine reads no seed it was given, so all
  `n` would be one text presented as independent samples.
- **`logprobs` is the runtime's declaration.** Requesting it where the runtime does not support
  logprobs is refused by name. `capabilities.py` declares it served by `torch` alone; `v41`, `mimo`,
  `xing4` and `qwen4_exp` refuse the field rather than answering with an empty array. See
  [Log probabilities](#log-probabilities).
- **`response_format` is the prompt's, not the sampler's.** The native path held the answer to the
  schema: a token constraint masked the engine's own vocabulary immediately before the per-row
  draw. No runtime here has that seam — sampling is a host-side function over a full logits tensor —
  so token-level constrained decoding went with the engine, and what survives is the checkpoint's
  own instruction (`encoding/deepseek_v4.py::response_format_template`), which the two DeepSeek
  encoders render. See [Structured outputs](#structured-outputs).

### Implemented

| Field | Endpoints | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `messages` | chat | The conversation, rendered by the checkpoint's own chat template (see [Request normalization](#request-normalization)). |
| `prompt` | completions | Tokenized and prefilled unchanged. |
| `max_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens` | both | The generation budget. `max_completion_tokens` wins when a request carries both, which is OpenAI's rule for the deprecated/current pair. A body carrying neither — or carrying `null` for either, which clients do send — asks for no cap: the answer runs until EOS or the context limit, resolved against the engine's own context the way vLLM (`max_model_len - input_length`) and SGLang resolve an absent cap. A backend that sizes its own caches — v41 — refuses a request whose prompt and budget together do not fit them, as a 400 before any work starts. |
| `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `seed` | both | Applied when the engine declares per-request sampling and top-k; otherwise a value that differs from the engine's effective one is a 400 from the sampling check rather than a silent substitution. |
| `stream` | both | Selects SSE deltas terminated by `[DONE]`. |
| `n` | both | The number of choices. Served by running the request `n` times, so the response holds one entry per choice with `index` running 0..n-1; see [Choices](#choices). |
| `response_format` | chat | `text`, `json_object` and `json_schema` reach the model as an instruction rendered into the prompt by the two DeepSeek encoders; a runtime whose encoder never renders it has no path for the field at all. See [Structured outputs](#structured-outputs). |
| `tools` | chat | Tool definitions reach the chat template, and a call the model writes back is reported in the assistant message's `tool_calls` rather than left in the text; see [Tool calls](#tool-calls). |
| `tool_choice` | chat | `"none"` drops the definitions, `"required"` and a named function become an instruction in the prompt; see [Tool calls](#tool-calls). |
| `stop` | both | Matched against the decoded text as it is produced, so the completion ends at the first occurrence of any sequence and the sequence itself is not part of the answer. The field is a string or a list of strings; a value of another shape is a 400. |
| `logprobs` | both | The sampled token's own log probability, and — on chat, up to `top_logprobs` of — the alternatives ranked at the same position; see [Log probabilities](#log-probabilities). A boolean on chat, a count on completions. |
| `top_logprobs` | chat | How many alternatives to rank per position alongside the sampled token. `0` reports the sampled token's probability and no alternatives. |
| `thinking_mode`, `reasoning_effort`, `add_generation_prompt`, `drop_thinking`, `request_id` | chat | PocketLLM extensions, not OpenAI fields. `thinking_mode` is `"chat"` or `"thinking"` and decides whether an answer is split at `</think>` into `content` and `reasoning_content`; `add_generation_prompt` (default `true`) decides whether the rendered prompt ends with the assistant header the model answers into, and `false` encodes the conversation as it stands — how a caller continues an assistant turn or inspects what the template does. |

#### Stop sequences

`stop` is matched against the **decoded text**, not against token ids. A stop string is not one
token — `"USER:"` is three in most vocabularies — and a sequence can begin inside one token and end
inside the next, so the only place it exists as a unit is the text the caller reads anyway. Matching
is applied to the cumulative text as it is produced, which gives the field the same meaning on a
non-streaming response and on a stream. The earliest occurrence of any sequence in the list ends the
completion, the sequence itself is not part of the answer, and `finish_reason` is reported as
`"stop"`.

Three details are worth knowing before relying on the field:

- **A partial sequence is withheld while streaming.** If the answer so far ends in a run of
  characters that is the beginning of a stop sequence, those bytes are held rather than sent,
  because the next token may complete the sequence and text already written to the socket cannot be
  taken back. Once generation ends the same bytes can no longer complete anything, so they are
  flushed as part of the answer. Nothing is withheld when the trailing characters cannot begin a
  sequence, which is the usual case — the hold is bounded by the longest sequence, not by the length
  of the text.
- **On chat, `stop` applies to the answer and not to `reasoning_content`.** The split between the
  two is read out of the text at `</think>`, and the search for a sequence starts after that marker.
  The block is a separate field whose text is not the completion, and the difference shows on the
  values clients actually send: `"\n\n"` is a common stop sequence and a reasoning block is full of
  blank lines, so matching the whole decode would end the answer before the model had written any
  of it — which a client reads as an empty answer rather than a truncated one.
- **`usage.completion_tokens` counts the tokens the engine generated**, which can exceed the number
  of tokens in the returned text when a sequence truncated it. The engine is not stopped early: the
  scheduler ends a request on token ids, and a client sequence is not one, so the request runs to its
  budget and only the text handed back is cut.

#### Choices

`n` is the number of completions one request asks for, and the server serves it by running the
request `n` times: each choice is its own runtime request, with its own seed derived from the
request's `seed`. The response carries one entry per choice with `index` running 0..`n`-1. `usage`
is counted the way OpenAI counts it: `prompt_tokens` once for the request, `completion_tokens` the
sum over the choices.

On a streamed response the choices arrive **one after another**, not interleaved, and each chunk
names the choice it belongs to in `index`. Interleaving would need the runtime to be driving several
requests at once, and a stream here is serialized against the engine's one mutable KV session — so
the choices are streamed in index order and the client reassembles them by index, which is what an
OpenAI stream is for. Each choice opens with its own `role: "assistant"` delta, the same way a
single-choice stream does. The practical consequence is latency rather than correctness: choice 2 of
3 does not begin until choice 1 has finished, so a client that wants all of them early is better off
sending `n` separate requests.

Four consequences are worth knowing:

- **Under greedy decoding every choice is the same text.** With `temperature` at 0 the seed is not
  read, so `n=3` returns the greedy answer three times. That is what a greedy request for three
  choices asks for; a caller who wants three different answers has to sample. The corresponding
  refusal is on the other side: an engine that fixes its sampling distribution engine-wide while the
  request asks for stochastic sampling cannot vary a choice at all, so `n>1` there is a 400 — three
  identical texts would otherwise be handed back as three independent samples.
- **`n` is refused above 128**, and refused for a fraction, a non-number, or a count below 1. The
  ceiling is this server's, not OpenAI's: one choice is one scheduler request, so the field is what
  bounds how much of the queue a single client can occupy.
- **The timeout is the request's, not the choice's.** A group of choices gets the one budget a
  single-choice request would have had, so a request wide enough that some of its choices wait
  behind the batch comes back with fewer entries than `n`. That is a 200 with a short `choices`
  array — the choices that did arrive are real answers — and not a failure. A response with no
  entries at all is a 500, or a 504 when the deadline was the reason. Cancelling the request cancels
  every choice.

#### Log probabilities

`logprobs` reports the probability the model assigned to each token it generated, and — when a count
of alternatives is given — the probabilities it assigned to the tokens it did *not* generate. The
two endpoints spell the same request differently, and this server follows each spelling rather than
picking one: on chat `logprobs` is a **boolean** and the number of alternatives lives in
`top_logprobs`, while on `/v1/completions` `logprobs` is the **count** itself. They are not
interchangeable, and the difference is not cosmetic — on chat `logprobs=false` means "not asked for",
while on completions `logprobs=0` is a real request for the sampled token's own probability with no
alternatives. A count sent to chat, or a boolean sent to completions, is a 400.

The answer is an array of one object per generated token, in order, under the choice's `logprobs`
key:

```json
{"logprobs":{"content":[
  {"token":"1","logprob":-0.0001234,"bytes":[49],"top_logprobs":[
    {"token":"1","logprob":-0.0001234,"bytes":[49]},
    {"token":"2","logprob":-9.21,"bytes":[50]}
  ]}
]}}
```

- **`token` is the surface text of one token**, not a word: `bytes` holds its UTF-8 encoding, which
  is how a caller reassembles text that a multi-byte character was split across. A token holding one
  piece of a multi-byte character is not valid UTF-8 on its own, so a client that wants the exact
  bytes should read `bytes` rather than re-encoding `token` — concatenating the `bytes` arrays in
  order reproduces the answer.
- **`logprob` is a natural log**, so it is always ≤ 0 and `exp(logprob)` is the probability.
- **`top_logprobs` ranks the model's own distribution, not the sampler's candidate set.** It is
  computed from the same raw logits the sampler draws from but over the whole vocabulary and before
  `temperature`, `top_k` or `top_p` touch it, so the numbers are comparable across positions and
  across requests. Ranking only the sampler's top-k candidates would inflate every probability by
  whatever mass the truncation dropped. Under `temperature` 0 the generated token is the argmax and
  is therefore the first entry, with the same `logprob` reported twice; when the request samples, the
  generated token is somewhere inside the requested alternatives rather than necessarily first.

Four things are worth knowing before relying on the field:

- **The array covers the text, not the token budget.** A stop token or a client `stop` sequence cuts
  the answer, and the array is cut with it — a position the caller never received is not reported.
  `usage.completion_tokens` still counts the tokens the engine generated, so it can exceed the number
  of entries in `content`.
- **On chat it covers the answer and not the reasoning block.** A thinking model decodes its
  reasoning first, and `message.content` is what follows it, so the array starts where the content
  starts: a client indexing into `content` and a client indexing into `logprobs.content` are looking
  at the same position. The reasoning block's own probabilities are therefore not reported, even
  though they were generated.
- **Streaming is not supported**, because a chunk carries the text of its token with no ranking
  beside it. `{"stream":true,"logprobs":...}` is a 400 rather than a stream that looks the same as
  one whose request asked for no ranking at all.
- **The runtime has to rank it, and the declaration is per runtime.** `logprobs` is refused by name
  where the runtime cannot rank a position — for `v41`, `mimo`, `xing4` and `qwen4_exp` it is a 400
  naming the field rather than a 200 carrying an empty array. Of the runtimes here only `torch` serves
  it. The limit on alternatives is this server's — 20 per position, above OpenAI's documented range —
  and a request past it is a 400 naming the ceiling.

#### Structured outputs

`response_format` is the field that asks for a machine-readable answer, and what it buys here is an
*instruction*: the checkpoint's own encoder renders the schema into the prompt as the line
`"## Response Format:"` followed by `"You MUST strictly adhere to the following schema to reply:"`
and the schema itself. The model is told the shape; nothing forces it, and the answer can still be
malformed JSON. A caller that needs a guarantee rather than a strong hint should validate what comes
back.

Three things follow from where the rendering lives:

- **`{"type": "text"}`** asks for nothing and is the shape an OpenAI client sends by default. It is
  accepted everywhere and renders nothing.
- **`{"type": "json_object"}` and `{"type": "json_schema"}`** render the schema block. The field is
  meaningful on the runtimes whose encoder has that block — `torch` (DeepSeek-V4) and `v41`
  (DeepSeek-V4.1) — and refused by name on the others.
- **The rendering needs a conversation, so this is a chat field.** A `/v1/completions` request
  carries a raw prompt with no message list, and there is nothing for the encoder to attach the
  schema to; a completion naming `response_format` is accepted and not rendered. Refusing it there
  instead would need a capability the row does not carry: the two runtimes that declare
  `structured_outputs` serve the field on chat and do not render it on completions, so `torch` writes
  JSON on `/v1/chat/completions` and returns unconstrained text when the same `response_format` is
  sent to `/v1/completions`.

The retired native path implemented this differently — a token mask over the engine's own
vocabulary, applied at the sampler, which *did* hold the model to the schema. That is recorded, with
its evidence, in [The native surface decision](../architecture/native_surface_decision.md). Two
limits on the instruction path are worth knowing:

- **The schema is rendered, not parsed.** This server reads the three shapes of `response_format`
  and hands the rest through; a well-formed but impossible schema is rendered as written and
  ignored by the model rather than refused.
- **The answer is not checked against the schema.** Nothing here parses the completion and
  re-asks on a violation, so `finish_reason: "stop"` says the model stopped, not that the JSON is
  valid.

#### Tool calls

`tools` is forwarded to the checkpoint's own chat template, and a call the model writes back is
reported in the assistant message's `tool_calls` array instead of being left in the text. The array
uses the OpenAI shape — an `id`, `type` set to `"function"`, and `function.name` with
`function.arguments` as a JSON string — and `finish_reason` is `"tool_calls"`, which is what a client
branching on the field expects to see before it runs the call and sends the result back in a
`tool`-role message.

That round trip is the one the acceptance test drives: the assistant message the server returned is
replayed verbatim alongside a `role: "tool"` result keyed on its `id`, and the answer comes back as an
ordinary `stop`. Both turns were checked through the `openai` and `langchain-openai` clients as well as
over bare HTTP — the [tool-calling acceptance record](https://github.com/lvyufeng/relic-engine/blob/master/docs/performance/cpp_openai_tool_acceptance.md)
has the request and response shapes.

Five things are worth knowing before relying on the field:

- **The schema is what types the arguments.** Qwen's template writes a call as XML —
  `<tool_call><function=NAME><parameter=ARG>VALUE</parameter></function></tool_call>` — and that shape
  records no type of its own: `<parameter=days>3</parameter>` is one character more than
  `<parameter=days>two</parameter>`. Each value is therefore read back against the type the request's
  own `parameters.properties` declares, so an argument declared `integer` arrives as the number `3`
  and one whose declared type is missing, unknown, or not parseable from the text arrives as the
  characters that were written. A request with no `tools` at all leaves every argument a string,
  because nothing in the text can settle whether `01234` meant a number.
- **Parsing is all-or-nothing.** A completion whose call was truncated at the token budget, is
  malformed, or has prose between two calls yields **no** `tool_calls`, and the text stays in
  `content` exactly as generated. A half-read call whose arguments look complete is worse than one
  whose syntax the caller can see.
- **Only a call syntax this server has read is parsed.** That is Qwen's template (`qwen3_5`,
  including the `qwen3_5_text` spelling) and DeepSeek-V4's own encoder, which already parsed its
  DSML calls. Any other architecture keeps the older behaviour and leaves the call in `content`;
  inventing a parse for a syntax nobody has read would drop or corrupt calls silently. The
  selection is one implementation (`pocketllm/protocol/templating.py`), so the checkpoint's
  architecture decides it the same way whichever runtime served the request. That module was the
  retired C++ front end's sidecar once, and the same checkpoint used to answer with the call as prose
  through one front end and with `tool_calls` through the other; there is one front end now, and one
  answer.
- **Streaming is not supported.** A streamed response carries the call syntax as content, exactly as
  it did before, and reports the engine's own `finish_reason`. Ask for a non-streaming response when
  you want `tool_calls`. The *reasoning* split is a different matter and does happen on a stream: a
  thinking-mode answer sends everything before `</think>` as `reasoning_content` deltas, so a client
  watches the reasoning instead of waiting for the answer.
- **The selection policy is applied.** `tool_choice: "auto"` is the default; `"none"` drops the
  definitions before the template is rendered, and `"required"` or a named function becomes an
  instruction in the prompt naming what must be called. The policy reaches the model rather than
  constraining the sampler, which is what SGLang does with the same field, so a client that asks for
  a call still reads the answer's `tool_calls` to find out whether one was made. A `tool_choice`
  naming a function that is not among `tools` is a 400. `parallel_tool_calls: false` is a 400: the
  model decides how many calls it makes and nothing here limits the count.

### Refused with HTTP 400

Each of these is refused only at a value that would change the output. The same field at the value
naming what the server already does — `logprobs=false` on chat, penalties of zero, an empty `stop`
list, an empty `logit_bias`, `echo=false` — is accepted, so a client that sends the documented
defaults explicitly is not punished for it. The two entries for a field this server *does* implement
are shape checks on the endpoint that defines the value, not refusals of the feature.

| Field | Endpoints | Refused when | What this server does instead |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stop` | both | the value is not a string and not a list of strings | Nothing is matched, so a well-formed `stop` is refused on shape alone rather than half-applied. Empty strings match nothing and are accepted, which is what makes an empty `stop` list — or the empty entries some clients pad it with — harmless. |
| `logprobs` | chat | not a boolean | A count is the other endpoint's spelling of the field; see [Log probabilities](#log-probabilities). |
| `logprobs` | completions | not a whole number in 0..20 | It is the number of alternatives to rank per position, above this server's ceiling of 20. |
| `top_logprobs` | completions | any value but `null` | The completions endpoint names the count in `logprobs` itself. |
| `top_logprobs` | chat | not a whole number in 0..20, or positive while `logprobs` is absent or `false` | There is no ranking to take alternatives from unless the request asked for log probabilities. |
| `logprobs` | both | asked for on a streaming request | A streamed chunk carries the text of its token with no ranking beside it. |
| `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty` | both | non-zero | The sampler has no repetition or presence term, so the request is generated as if the penalty were 0. |
| `logit_bias` | both | the object is not empty | No per-token bias is applied, so biased tokens are sampled at their unmodified probability. |
| `best_of` | completions | not 1 | One candidate is generated per request; there is no second candidate to compare it against. |
| `suffix` | completions | non-empty | The completion is returned on its own, with no suffix appended. |
| `echo` | completions | `true` | `text` holds only the generated continuation, never the prompt. |
| `tool_choice` | chat | a function choice naming a tool that is not in `tools` | A request error rather than a named-field refusal: the policy is applied to the prompt, so a name the prompt cannot be given is a request the server cannot render. |
| `parallel_tool_calls` | chat | `false` | The number of tool calls the model emits is not limited. |
| `stream_options.include_usage` | both | `true` on a streaming request | A stream is delta chunks followed by `[DONE]`, and none of them carries `usage`. A non-streaming response already reports usage, so the option is satisfied there and accepted. |

The refusal uses the OpenAI error shape with `type` set to `invalid_request_error`, `param` set to
the offending field, and `code` to `unsupported_feature`, so a client can act on it without parsing
the prose:

```json
{"error":{"message":"\"stop\" = 5 is not supported by this server: a stop sequence is a string, or a list of strings, and this value is neither. Send \"stop\" as a string or an array of strings.","type":"invalid_request_error","param":"stop","code":"unsupported_feature"}}
```

The check runs before dispatch, so a request this server will not serve is refused whole rather than
streamed halfway and abandoned. Which fields are refused at which values is
`pocketllm/protocol/contract.py`, and the runtime's own answer is `BackendBase.audit_request`: the
*shape* of a field is the same on every runtime and is checked host-side, while whether a runtime's
answer applies a field at all depends on the runtime and is declared per runtime — from the same
table `/v1/models` publishes, so the two cannot disagree about what this runtime serves. The entries
above that are the runtime's rather than the socket's are `logprobs` (`torch` alone ranks a position)
and `response_format` (`torch` and `v41` render it into the prompt); see
[Log probabilities](#log-probabilities) and [Structured outputs](#structured-outputs).

### Accepted and inert

These cannot change the generated text, so they are accepted and ignored rather than refused:
`user`, `store`, `metadata`, `service_tier`, and `model`. The server serves exactly one model and
echoes its configured name back, so a `model` naming something else is not a routing request it can
honour — but rejecting it would break clients over nothing.

`parallel_tool_calls` is the exception that shows the rule is applied per value rather than per
field: `true` is inert and accepted, while `false` asks for a limit that is not enforced and is
refused with the rest of the table above.

## Configuration precedence

Prefer typed `EngineArgs` and explicit CLI options. `EngineArgs.from_env()` exists as a compatibility bridge for legacy deployments. Runtime tuning variables are named `POCKETLLM_*` (renamed from `DSV4_*`, a breaking change — see [the migration note](https://github.com/lvyufeng/relic-engine/blob/master/docs/migration/dsv4-to-pocket-rename.md)); `QWEN_*` and related names are unchanged. Backend-specific tuning belongs in `backend_options` and must not be assumed portable between CUDA and Ascend.

## Native C++ engine (retired) { #native-c-python-module }

Earlier versions of this guide documented a native C/C++ bridge: a `pocketllm_cpp` pybind module
built from `cpp_engine/`, a `QwenEngine` / `QwenBatchScheduler` Python surface, and an NCCL-gated
build you opted into with `POCKETLLM_BUILD_CPP=1`. None of it is part of this repository any more.
It was retired with the `cpp` backend: there is no `cpp_engine/` tree here, no `ext_modules` in
`setup.py`, and `import pocketllm_cpp` resolves to nothing.

The engine itself — the Python bindings, the batch scheduler and the scheduler-backed async request
API that used to be documented here — lives in the archived
[relic-engine](https://github.com/lvyufeng/relic-engine). Read its own documentation for that
surface. Every runtime in *this* repository is pure PyTorch.

Two APIs existed only on the native side, and what happened to each is a decision rather than a
side effect of the deletion: the engine's tokenizer was **not** moved, and token-level constrained
decoding was **dropped** while the checkpoint's own prompt instruction for `response_format` was
kept. [The native surface decision](../architecture/native_surface_decision.md) holds the evidence,
the measured defect that the prompt-layer path itself had, and what its fix changes.


## Backend selection

`backend="auto"` asks each runtime in `AUTO_ORDER` (`v41`, `mimo`, `xing4`, `qwen4_exp`, `torch`)
whether it identifies the checkpoint, and takes the first that says yes. Every entry claims an
architecture and refuses the others, so a checkpoint nothing claims is refused by name rather than
routed into the last runtime — `UnsupportedFeatureError: no backend serves this checkpoint; auto
tried v41, mimo, xing4, qwen4_exp, torch`. An explicit `--backend` for a checkpoint the named runtime
does not serve raises the same error before anything loads.

`backend="v41"` is the first thing `auto` tests for: a checkpoint whose config
says `deepseek_v41` — at the root, or `deepseek_v41_text` under `text_config`, which is where the
released V4.1 file keeps it — goes to it. It runs the `relicllm/models/deepseek_v4_1` PyTorch
runtime over the checkpoint's safetensors shards, one process a rank under `--tensor-parallel-size`,
and it reports `supports_batch=False`: one mutable KV state, serialized at the backend boundary.
`--backend v41` on a GGUF checkpoint, or on a config that is not V4.1, raises
`UnsupportedFeatureError` before anything loads.

Capabilities are declared per runtime in `relicllm/backends/capabilities.py` rather than reported by
an adapter at run time, so there is one answer per runtime instead of one per code path — the same
declaration a request is refused on by name and `/v1/models` publishes. The V4.1 adapter ranks no
logprobs — a request asking for them is refused rather than served without them — while prefix
caching follows `prefix_cache_bytes`, which defaults to 4 GiB a rank and can be set to zero to turn
the reuse off. Its `cancellation` detail names the mechanism rather than promising a latency: a
cancellation is a per-step collective between the ranks and cannot interrupt a prompt's forward.

`backend="mimo"` is the adapter for MiMo-V2.6-Flash. `--backend mimo` names it, and `auto` reaches it
too — the checkpoint's `model_type` is `mimo_v2`, which the factory recognizes the way it recognizes
`deepseek_v41`, so a MiMo release gets this adapter from either. What it runs is
[MiMo-V2.6-Flash](../models/mimo-v2.6-flash.md)'s runtime: `relicllm/models/mimo_v2` over the release,
the routed experts in host memory, one process a rank under `--tensor-parallel-size`, and it reports
`supports_batch=False`. Two things about it are not the other adapters':

- **Rank 0 cannot start a request without telling the workers.** Every routed layer closes with an
  `all_reduce`, so a rank that is not running the request its peers are running is at a *different*
  collective and NCCL answers that by hanging. The adapter broadcasts each request — prompt ids,
  budget, sampler, seed — before it runs it, and a cancel is a per-step `broadcast` of one flag for
  the same reason. A rank that decided to stop on its own would leave three peers inside a layer.
- **`max_model_len` is the KV cache.** A MiMo deployment sizes one cache at startup (32768
  positions by default) and every request is clamped to what is left of it; a prompt that fills it
  is refused before any work starts, with the number and the flag to raise. Its options are
  `--prefill-chunk-tokens` (tokens a prefill call, 2048 by default), `--chunk-rows` (experts a
  grouped expert call, which trades arena bytes for call count), `--slots`, `--expert-deal` (`deal`
  is the older spelling of the same option as a `--backend-option` key) and `--pin`, and an unknown
  one is a `ConfigurationError` rather than a silent default.

## Request normalization

`pocketllm.protocol` holds the request normalization the server runs: OpenAI content-block
flattening, tool attachment and `tool_choice` instructions, `reasoning`/`reasoning_effort` handling,
tool-call shaping, and stop-string truncation. There is one implementation, and it imports neither
Torch nor the native module. It used to be shared with a second, model-owned server
(`relicllm.server.openai`, since retired with the rest of the duplicate front ends — see
[#447](https://github.com/lvyufeng/PocketLLM/issues/447)); the module that server's runtime half
became is `relicllm/models/deepseek_v4/serving.py`.

`/v1/chat/completions` puts the normalized messages, thinking mode, reasoning effort, and tool
metadata in `GenerationRequest.metadata`. The shared prompt boundary first asks the selected
checkpoint tokenizer to apply its own `chat_template` with an assistant generation prompt. This is
the same model-owned-template contract used by vLLM/SGLang and preserves model-specific special
tokens, reasoning controls, and tool formatting. For DeepSeek checkpoints whose tokenizer has no
chat template, the validated legacy `relicllm.encoding.deepseek_v4.encode_messages` format is used instead.
`GenerationRequest.prompt` still carries a deterministic `role: content` rendering only as a last-resort
fallback for generic tokenizers that provide neither format. `/v1/completions` passes `prompt` through
unchanged and validates that a list prompt contains only strings.

The template receives normalized tool definitions and a private compatibility copy of prior tool-call
arguments; public request metadata is never mutated. Template-specific reasoning names are mapped to
the vocabulary accepted by the checkpoint (for example, `high`/`max` map to Qwen's `xhigh`).
Unsupported model-specific template features remain the responsibility of the selected backend.

**DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash is the case that contract does not cover, because its tokenizer has no
template at all**: the format is a Python module the release ships inside the checkpoint, at
`<checkpoint>/encoding/encoding.py`. `backend="v41"` therefore renders a chat request by importing
that module by path and calling its own `encode_messages`, rather than by falling back to a generic
renderer the model was never trained on. What this repository wraps around it is the reasoning-effort
vocabulary (`1`–`100`, or `minimal`/`medium`/`low`/`high`/`max`) and a tolerant `</think>` split for
a reply that stops mid-reasoning; tool definitions ride along on the first system message, where the
control plane already put them. A checkpoint without that module, or an effort the encoder will not
render, is refused with `ConfigurationError` and a pointer to `/v1/completions`, so a caller can send
a prompt it rendered itself. `/v1/completions` on this backend passes the prompt through the
tokenizer untouched, which is also what the launcher does with `--prompt`.

A backend that separates reasoning from content can set `reasoning_content` and `tool_calls` in its
result or event metadata; those are forwarded to the response and to streamed deltas. A backend that
does not simply omits them.

## Termination semantics

The runtime decides when generation stops, and the answer is read off the model's own tokenizer. The
first EOS token ends the request, is excluded from the returned token ids and text, and yields
`finish_reason="stop"`. `finish_reason="length"` means the token budget ended first. Usage counts the
step that produced the EOS, so streaming and offline usage agree.

EOS ids are resolved from the tokenizer the runtime loaded — a tuple on a checkpoint like MiMo-V2.6
whose release ends a turn with either of two control tokens. The retired C++ adapter had a longer
chain that also consulted `generation_config.json`, the native engine's own `eos_id` and an
`eos_source` detail; none of that is part of this repository, and there is no `eos_source` field to
read.

## Cancellation semantics

`cancel(request_id)` returns `True` only for a request that is currently active, and cancellation is
observed at safe boundaries between generation steps. It never interrupts a running device kernel and
never rolls back a partially executed step. `DELETE /v1/requests/<request_id>` returns HTTP 404 for an
unknown or already-finished request.

Cancellation is a per-step collective on the tensor-parallel runtimes: a rank that decided to stop on
its own would leave its peers inside a layer, so the flag is broadcast rather than acted on locally.
See each model page for what that means for its own request lock.
