# Migration notes

Breaking changes to PocketLLM's configuration and default behaviour, one note per change, each
recording what changed, who is affected, and what to set instead.

| Note | The change |
|---|---|
| [A `max_tokens` the context cannot hold is refused](overlong-max-tokens-is-refused.md) | `--backend mimo` and `--backend xing4` now answer an explicit `max_tokens` larger than what the prompt leaves with a 400 instead of allocating a cache past `--max-model-len`. `v41`, `torch` and `cpp` are unchanged. |
| [A `--max-batch-size` that cannot be honoured is refused](unhonourable-batch-width-is-refused.md) | `--max-batch-size` above 1, or `--enable-batching`, on a build or checkpoint with no batch scheduler raises instead of warning and serving one request at a time. The default path is unchanged. |
| [The C++ binary's `--serve` front end is removed](https://github.com/lvyufeng/relic-engine/blob/master/docs/migration/native-serve-front-end-removed.md) | `pocketllm_engine --serve` no longer exists: `pocketllm serve --backend cpp` is the only HTTP front end, `--max-context` is `--max-model-len`, `--tp-world`/`--tp-rank` are `--tensor-parallel-size`, and the `--serve`-only knobs (`--kv-paged`, `--kv-block-size`, `--prefill-token-budget`, `--python`, `--sidecar`) moved or went away. |
| [`--device` splits into a platform and a card list](device-splits-into-platform-and-cards.md) | `--device` no longer names a card: it is the platform (`auto`/`cuda`/`ascend`/`cpu`), and the cards are `--device-ids 2,3`, one per rank. `--device cuda:2`, `--device 0` and `--backend-option device=…` are refused by name. |
| [Batching is on by default for the `cpp` backend](batching-default-on.md) | `pocketllm serve --backend cpp` now runs the batch scheduler at 8 slots where it used to run the serialized session, so per-request latency and KV memory both change unless a width is named. |
| [The `dsv4` to `pocket` rename](https://github.com/lvyufeng/relic-engine/blob/master/docs/migration/dsv4-to-pocket-rename.md) | Environment variables and module paths were renamed from `DSV4_*` to `POCKETLLM_*`; the old spellings are not read. |
