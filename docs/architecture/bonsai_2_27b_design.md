# Ternary-Bonsai-2-27B: design and measurements

This is task 6 of 6 in [stage 1 of the checkpoint roadmap](https://github.com/lvyufeng/PocketLLM/blob/master/docs/architecture/pocketllm_new_model_roadmap.md#stage-1--ternary-bonsai-2-27b)
([#387](https://github.com/lvyufeng/PocketLLM/issues/387) under [#381](https://github.com/lvyufeng/PocketLLM/issues/381)),
the last one: wire the checkpoint to `pocketllm serve`, measure it there, and write it down. The five
pages before it are the [reference gate](ternary_bonsai_2_reference_gate.md), the container reader,
the Hadamard, and the [sm_75 dense GEMM](https://github.com/lvyufeng/relic-core/blob/master/docs/architecture/ternary_bonsai_2_dense_gemm.md); the user-facing page is
[the model guide](../models/ternary-bonsai-2-27b.md).

**Verdict: served on one card, and the prefill number the earlier stages recorded was wrong — for a
reason worth the whole page.** A prompt whose token count is a multiple of 64 prefills at
**636–647 tok/s**, which is 99% of what the upstream reference reaches on the same card, not the 35%
that the dense-GEMM stage measured. One token over the boundary costs **11.7 seconds**: a 4,096-token
prompt and a 4,097-token prompt differ by that much, on the same server, same content, one token. The
per-token rate is otherwise flat at 1.55 ms from 2,048 to 22,378 tokens, so the entire "prefill is 2.8×
behind the reference" gap is a ragged-tail effect in the final chunk, and the number this page records
for the stage is the aligned one.

Everything below was measured on this checkout, on **RTX 2080 Ti 0** (22,528 MiB, PCIe, sm_75), the
released `Ternary-Bonsai-2-27B-PTQ1_0.gguf`, one request at a time. Where a number is a single
reading it says so; where it is a difference between two arms, both arms are stated. The prompts are
repository documents, so every one of them can be reproduced from the checkout — `README.md`, the
pages of this documentation tree, and prefixes of them by token count. Token counts are the engine's
own, read from `/metrics`, not estimates.

## Runtime status

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | `pocketllm serve --model <file>.gguf` selects the native C++ engine with no flag |
| Cards | 1, no NVLink needed |
| Context served | 245,760 tokens at an FP16 KV cache; 262,144 with `--kv-cache-dtype fp8` |
| Acceptance | the server answers a chat completion from the released checkpoint on one 2080 Ti |
| Prefill, 4,096-token prompt | 6.44 s — **636.0 tok/s** |
| Decode, at that context | **25.89 tok/s** |
| Memory, weights + runtime | 6,566 MiB, of which 5.53 GiB is the ternary file |
| What it does not do | no batching in practice (measured, below), no speculative decoding, greedy only |

## What serving needed

Two things, and neither was a runtime change.

**Backend selection already worked, at the registry.** The file declares
`general.architecture = qwen35`, and the C++ registry canonicalizes `qwen35` onto the `qwen3_5` name
that the Qwen3.8-27B runtime claims, so the engine that runs the FP8 checkpoint is the engine that
runs this one, unmodified. The gap was on the Python side: the adapter's factory refused a GGUF
checkpoint before it asked the registry. That is the whole of
[#413](https://github.com/lvyufeng/PocketLLM/pull/413) — a `gguf_is_servable` predicate, the file
substituted for a directory when the adapter hands the checkpoint down, and a test that pins the
canonicalization.

**The tokenizer comes out of the file.** A GGUF holds the vocabulary, the merges, the special-token
ids and the chat template, and this one declares `tokenizer.ggml.pre = qwen35`, whose pre-tokenizer is
the same digit-splitting rule the other Qwen-family checkpoints use. `build_gguf_bpe_tokenizer` reads
the header; `tests/test_gguf_tokenizer_pre.py` pins the split on a synthetic vocabulary so a
regression there cannot hide behind a real one.

The released directory holds a **second artifact** beside the file this stage serves
(`Ternary-Bonsai-2-27B-PQ2_0.gguf`, GGML type 142), so a directory naming two checkpoints is refused
with its own message rather than resolved by listing order. `PQ2_0` has no kernel: the loader decodes
its geometry and refuses it by name, which is deliberate — reading a 2.13-bit block as though it were
`PTQ1_0` would produce plausible tokens from the wrong numbers.

## The measurement harness

`tests/bench_pocketllm_serve_phases.py` splits one served request into prefill and decode from the
**engine's own clock**, not from chunk arrival times: `pocketllm_ttft_seconds_sum/_count` is the time to
the first generated token, `pocketllm_request_duration_seconds_sum` the whole request. By this
repository's [timing convention](../guides/benchmarking.md) the first token is produced by the prompt
forward and therefore belongs to prefill, so `prefill_tps = prompt_tokens / ttft`. The script refuses
to report a row whose metric deltas are not exactly one request's — the trap being a stray health
check or a second client landing inside the window.

`tests/bench_pocketllm_serve_concurrency.py` is the third of these server benchmarks: several
simultaneous non-streamed requests, aggregate tokens a second against the same figure at concurrency
1. It is non-streamed on purpose — the streaming path holds one lock for a whole generation, because
the engine has a single mutable KV session, so a streamed run would measure the lock.

## The ragged tail: what actually governs prefill

The stage's headline number was 225.9 tok/s at a 4,108-token prompt, against the reference's
642.5 tok/s at 4,096, and it was read as a kernel being 2.8× too slow. It is not a rate. It is a step.

Here is the step, served, on one server configuration, two prompts whose content is identical except
for the last token (`README.md` truncated to 4,079 and to 4,080 tokens; the chat template brings the
rendered prompt to 4,096 and 4,097):

| Rendered prompt | TTFT | Prefill | Decode |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **4,096 tokens** (64 × 64) | **6.440 s** | **636.0 tok/s** | 25.89 tok/s |
| 4,097 tokens | 18.106 s | 226.3 tok/s | 25.76 tok/s |

One token, 11.7 seconds. And the aligned rate holds at the other boundary:

| Rendered prompt | TTFT | Prefill |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 8,192 tokens (64 × 128) | 12.818 s | 639.1 tok/s |

At the engine, one prefill per document, `prefix_cache` off, a fresh process each so nothing can
resume, the same document cut to a token count — the rate is flat at the top and the step is at the
bottom:

| Tokens | ms a token | tok/s | |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 2,048 (64 × 32) | 1.59 | 628.1 | aligned |
| 4,096 (64 × 64) | 1.55 | 646.7 | aligned |
| 8,192 (64 × 128) | 1.58 | 634.6 | aligned |
| 9,216 (64 × 144) | 1.60 | 625.5 | aligned |
| 4,100 | 4.40 | 227.4 | +4 |
| 4,112 | 2.76 | 362.6 | +16 |
| 4,128 (32 × 129) | 2.02 | 495.3 | +32 |
| 4,159 | 4.40 | 227.4 | +63 |
| 4,161 | 4.46 | 224.4 | +1 into a second tile |

The pattern in the last column is the cost, and it is a function of the **tail**, not of the length or
of the text:

| Tail past the last whole 64-token tile | Penalty | |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | 12.2 s | |
| 4 | 11.7 s | |
| 16 | 5.0 s | |
| 32 | 1.9 s | |
| 63 | 11.9 s | |

so the engine is processing the final ragged chunk through something that costs about
**0.4 s for every slot of the tile it cannot fill**, up to ~12 s, and nothing at all when the tile is
full. That fit is from the 4,0xx series above and it is a description, not a law: the longer
documents' totals land within a few seconds of what it predicts rather than on it. The shape of the
cost is a fallback that does the whole model's work again for the ragged chunk rather than tiling it,
which is exactly the "prefill tile geometry" that
[#406](https://github.com/lvyufeng/PocketLLM/issues/406) tracks — but that is a reading of the shape,
not a diagnosis, and one number says it is not a plain re-read: a pass over the 5.53 GiB weight set
costs 11 ms at this card's measured 526 GiB/s, so 11.7 s is a thousand times that. It is within a
factor of the file read off a disk at ~500 MB/s, which is a coincidence this page will not lean on —
the penalty reproduces on the sixth run of a series, long after the file is in the page cache.
**The mechanism is not diagnosed here**; what is measured is the penalty, its trigger, and that it is
not a throughput ceiling.

Three things follow, and they were all checked:

- **It is not the document.** `docs/models/mimo-v2.6-flash.md` whole is 3,422 tokens and measures
  224–228 tok/s; the same file cut to 2,880 tokens (64 × 45) measures 640 tok/s in a fresh process.
  Alternating a prompt and a one-token-variant of it three times each in one process reproduces
  4.4 ms and 1.9 ms a token per variant, to three figures, so it is neither warm-up nor drift.
- **It is not the chunk size.** README at 11,024 tokens, one fresh process per row: chunk 2,048
  → 560.8 tok/s, 4,096 → 515.2, 8,192 → 517.4, 16,384 → 355.5. Smaller chunks are worth a few per
  cent, and no chunk setting crosses the step.
- **It is not the card.** No other process held a GPU during any of these runs
  (`nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps` empty), and the numbers reproduce across sessions.

### What this does to the earlier stage's numbers

The dense-GEMM page measured prefill at a **fixed 512-row shape** — 600 tok/s of dense projections —
and 512 is a multiple of 64, so that number is on the fast path and stands. The stage-6 number that
was wrong is the *whole-model* one: 4,108 tokens is not a multiple of 64, so the 18.19 s it took was
6.4 s of prefill plus a 11.8 s ragged-tail penalty, and reading it as a rate put the model at 35% of
the reference when the aligned figure is 99%.

Served end to end, at `--max-model-len 32768`, one request at a time, greedy, 64 generated tokens:

| Prompt (repository document) | Prompt tokens | TTFT | Prefill | Decode |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `README.md` cut to an aligned 4,096 | 4,096 | 6.44 s | **636.0 tok/s** | 25.89 tok/s |
| the same cut to 4,097 | 4,097 | 18.11 s | 226.3 tok/s | 25.76 tok/s |
| `README.md` cut to an aligned 8,192 | 8,192 | 12.82 s | 639.1 tok/s | 25.44 tok/s |
| `README.md` whole | 11,040 | 19.2 s | 571–576 tok/s | 25.0 tok/s |
| `docs/architecture/qwen3_8_27b_fp8_design.md` | 12,659 | 33.6 s | 374.6–376.6 tok/s | 24.9 tok/s |
| `docs/performance/serving_throughput_scaling.md` | 22,389 | 56.1 s | 398.9 tok/s | 24.1 tok/s |
| `docs/architecture/ternary_bonsai_2_reference_gate.md` | 6,151 | 27.6 s | 222.6 tok/s | 25.5 tok/s |
| a prompt that repeats the one just served | 5,032 | **0.023 s** | — | 25.6 tok/s |

The multi-chunk rows are the same rule read twice: 11,040 splits into an aligned 8,192 and a 2,848
tail of 32, which the engine answers at 571 tok/s — between the aligned rate and the ragged one,
which is what a 1.9 s tail against 11,040 tokens predicts.

### Against the upstream reference, same card

| | PocketLLM, one card | llama.cpp `prism`, one card |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Prefill, aligned | **636.0 tok/s at 4,096** | 642.5 tok/s at 4,096 |
| Prefill, aligned | 639.1 tok/s at 8,192 | 615.2 tok/s at 8,192 |
| Decode | 25.9 tok/s at 4,096 | 30.7 tok/s |

Prefill is level with the reference — 99% at 4,096, 104% at 8,192 — and decode is 84% of it. The
reference's own `llama-bench` prefills in one shot and therefore never pays the tail, which is worth
saying explicitly: the comparison is aligned-to-aligned, and a serving stack that hands the engine
arbitrary prompt lengths does not get to be aligned by accident.

## Memory on one card

| | |
| --- | ---: |
| The ternary file | 5.53 GiB — 402 `ptq1_0` tensors, 5,946,648,928 bytes |
| Weights plus runtime, no request | **6,566 MiB** |
| KV | **64 KiB a token** — 16 full-attention layers × 4 KV heads × 256 × 2 × 2 bytes |
| Idle at `--max-model-len 8192` | 7,078 MiB |
| After the first cold 4K prompt | 8,952 MiB, flat from there |
| The most that fits, FP16 KV | **245,760 tokens** — 15,360 MiB of KV + 6,566 MiB of the rest |
| 262,144 tokens | needs `--kv-cache-dtype fp8`; 15,014 MiB on the card |

The KV half is the same number derived two ways. The architecture gives 64 KiB a token; four fresh
processes at `--max-model-len` 2,048, 8,192, 16,384 and 32,768 measured 6,694, 7,078, 7,590 and
8,614 MiB, which is 64 KiB a token above a **6,566 MiB** intercept, to the megabyte:

| `--max-model-len` | Measured | Intercept + KV |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2,048 | 6,694 MiB | 6,566 + 128 |
| 8,192 | 7,078 MiB | 6,566 + 512 |
| 16,384 | 7,590 MiB | 6,566 + 1,024 |
| 32,768 | 8,614 MiB | 6,566 + 2,048 |

`--max-model-len 253952` is refused at start with `RuntimeError: device_malloc Qwen runtime tensor`:
the arena does not fit. 245,760 is the largest FP16-KV context, and fp8 halves the KV so the
checkpoint's own 262,144 fits.

**The workspace is a per-thread cache, and it used to leak.** A cold prefill of a long prompt leaves
~430 MiB on the card for a 4K prompt, because the chunk's activation scratch is cached per thread at
its high-water mark rather than reallocated per chunk. That is intended. What was not: the cache was a
trivially destructible `thread_local` holding a raw device pointer, so it was never released when the
thread went away, and `ThreadingHTTPServer` answers each connection on a fresh thread — one workspace
per request, 430 MiB a prompt, linear, until the card filled. Fixed in
[#414](https://github.com/lvyufeng/PocketLLM/pull/414) with a destructor that frees it, and measured
before and after on the same tree, eight cold 4,096-token prompts, one process both times:

| | fresh | after #1 | after #2 | … | after #8 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| before | 7,078 | 9,382 | 9,812 | | 12,392 MiB |
| after | 7,078 | 8,952 | 8,952 | | 8,952 MiB |

The direct engine path never showed it because it reuses one thread.

## Concurrency, and why it is off

The batch scheduler is in the engine and the adapter can reach it — `--backend-option
enable_batching=true --backend-option max_batch_size=4`. Two prompts, prefix caching off in both
arms, one timed group of simultaneous non-streamed requests per level, aggregate generated tokens a
second over the whole group against concurrency 1. Both arms were measured on this branch, in one
invocation each, so the only difference between the columns is the flag.

A short prompt — `"The capital of France is"`, 17 prompt tokens, 9 generated, because this model
stops on its own well short of the 64 asked for:

| Concurrency | Serial | Batched |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 21.49 tok/s (1.00×) | 20.48 tok/s (1.00×) |
| 2 | 21.58 tok/s (1.00×) | 25.47 tok/s (1.24×) |
| 4 | 21.54 tok/s (1.00×) | **36.53 tok/s (1.78×)** |

And a prompt long enough for prefill to matter — the reference-gate page truncated to 2,032 tokens,
which the template renders to 2,044, 64 generated:

| Concurrency | Serial | Batched |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 5.51 tok/s (1.00×) — 11.61 s | 5.45 tok/s (1.00×) — 11.74 s |
| 2 | 5.44 tok/s (0.99×) — 23.55 s | 5.77 tok/s (1.06×) — 22.17 s |
| 4 | 5.37 tok/s (0.97×) — median 35.75 s, slowest 47.69 s | **6.23 tok/s (1.14×)** — 41.09 s |

Read the serial column as the queue it is: one worker, so the aggregate does not move and the fourth
caller waits as long as the four before it. Batching buys 1.78× on the short prompt and 1.14× on the
long one, and charges for it in latency — at 2,044 tokens the batched group's median is 41.09 s
where the serial queue's median is 35.75 s, so four callers wait longer in total than they would
have queued, and only the queue's last caller (47.69 s) waits longer than that.

**On determinism, this page corrects an earlier reading of its own.** The batching caveat was first
written as "a greedy answer can depend on the batch": four identical requests in one group produced
two distinct texts, and a prompt choosing between `"5:00:00"` and `"0:15:00"` gave one row each.
That measurement came from a build whose greedy runs on that prompt did not stop at `</s>` — all 64
tokens were `"!"` — and on this tree the same probe gives `'The capital of France is **Paris**.'` at
nine tokens, identical across all four rows, with the prefix cache on and off and over repeated
runs. The two are not the same regime, so the caveat is **not** reproduced here and is not claimed
for this build; what remains is the latency trade-off above, and a note that the earlier observation
is unexplained rather than withdrawn.

`--backend-option kv_paged=true` is the other opt-in, and it is measured in the model guide: the
prefix resume disappears (a repeated prompt is forwarded in full every time) and decode loses about
3% (25.0 against 25.8 tok/s). Paging exists for the case where one arena will not do.

**The prefix resume is a resume, not a store.** The engine keeps the state of the request it just
served. A, A, B, B, A gives 0.023 s and 0.014 s TTFT for the two repeats and a full prefill for the A
at the end, so a repeat of the immediately preceding prompt resumes and a repeat of an earlier one
does not, whatever `--enable-prefix-caching` or the arena size says. In the served table above the
resumed request is the one at 0.023 s.

## The Ascend port

Four first-generation 910B cards run the same file through the same engine and the same weight map.
The container, the transform and the tokenizer are backend-independent — the weight map decides what
a tensor *is* before any backend sees it — so the port is three decisions and one bug.

**The format is unpacked at load rather than at use.** No Ascend kernel reads a sub-byte weight, and
the primitives one would need are missing rather than unwritten: the gather and pad-copy families are
stubs on this silicon, there is no UB-to-L1 copy path, and the unary set has no floor, truncation or
rounding, which is what a trit index would have to be computed with. So `qwen_materialize_host_tensor`
decodes `PTQ1_0` to FP16 while the tensor is still in host memory and the device receives the decoded
bytes. One predicate decides which of the two happens — `qwen_backend_reads_packed_ternary()` — and
both the shape arithmetic (`ternary_storage_shape`) and the materializer read it, so a rank cannot
compute its byte offsets for one layout and upload the other. The cost is 16 bits a weight where the
checkpoint holds 1.75.

**Three tensors are no longer a shard of a folded matrix.** A column-parallel weight whose shard stops
inside a 1024-element rotation block cannot rotate its own activation: it holds a slice of the rotated
axis, and the block it would need is on another rank. The loader resolves this the other way — it
applies the inverse transform to the weight once, at load, and the site becomes an ordinary dense
multiply. At TP4 this is `out_proj`, `o_proj` and `down_proj`, and it is why the ternary model's
`down_proj` is a plain FP16 `[5120, 4352]` per rank rather than a slice of a folded `[5120, 17408]`.
The decision lives in `qwen_rotation_needs_weight_unfold`, and both the weight map (which sets
`QwenLinearRef::input_rotated`) and the materializer (which does the unfolding) call it with the same
numbers, so the two cannot disagree about which frame a given weight is in.

**The fold flag has to survive a weight fusion, and it did not.** `fuse_linear_rows` concatenates two
projections along their output rows so one GEMM produces both — `gate_proj` with `up_proj` for the MLP
(`fuse_ab_projection`, on by default), and `in_proj_a` with `in_proj_b` for the Gated DeltaNet. It
copies `kind` and `logical_shape` onto the fused linear, because `Linear::forward` dispatches on both.
It did not copy `input_rotated`, which `Linear::forward` also dispatches on — so the fused `gate_up`
arrived at the GEMM with the **default `false`** and skipped the rotation, feeding an unrotated
activation into a weight written against the rotated frame.

Nothing could catch it downstream: both halves of the concatenation are individually consistent, the
shapes are right, the kernel is right, and the output is a plausible-looking tensor. On a dense
checkpoint the flag is `false` on both operands and the fusion is correct by accident, which is why
the whole CUDA record above was unaffected; the defect needs a folded checkpoint *and* a fusion, and
this is the first checkpoint that is both. It presented as fluent nonsense — the model answered `The
capital of France is` with a repeating two-token cycle — and nothing else.

The fix propagates the flag (`fused.input_rotated = first.input_rotated`), refuses the fusion when
the two operands disagree, which no single input can satisfy, and checks the invariant where it is
consumed, in `FusedGateUpSwiGLU::forward`. That last check is a host-side comparison of two structs
and costs one branch per layer per step; it exists because the failure mode is silent, and because
the class of bug — a hand-written field copy that misses a field the dispatch reads — is one a future
fusion can repeat.

**TP4, because TP8 is not available.** The model has 4 KV heads and 8 does not divide them, so a
rank's share would be a partial head. The layout is the one the FP8 sibling uses: column-parallel
`qkv`/`gate`/`up`/`z`, row-parallel `out_proj`/`o_proj`/`down_proj`, and the packed `[q | k | v]`
tensor cut in segments rather than as one range so no rank receives part of a head it cannot use.

### What the port measures

`scripts/run_qwen_ascend_tp4.sh`, four 910B cards, the released `PTQ1_0` file, greedy:

| | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Load, 64 layers × 4 ranks | **~23 s** — 12.53 GiB of FP16 weights a rank |
| Decode, one row | 23.6 tok/s, 15 tokens |
| Decode, 16 rows batched | **173.6 tok/s**, 92.2 ms a step |
| Card memory, one row | 19.60 GiB of 32 |

The load is host work, not transfer. The dense sibling checkpoint puts the same 12.53 GiB a rank on
the card in 35.5 s, because it reads FP16 off disk; here the engine reads 5.95 GB, decodes 402
ternary tensors on the host, and pushes the same 12.53 GiB — and it now does that in less time than
the sibling spends copying. Two changes to the Hadamard weight unfold got it there, and they were
measured apart from each other.

**Three arms, two runs each, interleaved, same command line.** `model_load_seconds` out of rank 0's
own startup line, the field both earlier records quoted, with the four-rank mean beside it:

| Arm | Binary | rank 0 | 4-rank mean |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| `old` | `master`, `15d239516d` | 123.79 / 122.99 s | 122.6 / 120.5 s |
| `blocks` | + the block range, `QWEN_LOAD_THREADS=1`, `c47ffe9f7d` | 63.08 / 62.93 s | 63.7 / 63.6 s |
| `threads` | + the row fan-out, 16 workers, `c47ffe9f7d` | 22.70 / 24.87 s | 23.1 / 24.6 s |

**5.1× in all**, in two steps of 1.9× and 2.7×, on bit-identical weights. The harness proves that
rather than assuming it: all three arms emit the same eight greedy tokens, `seed_mismatches=0` and
`verify_compared=48` are unchanged, and `step_ms` does not move — 90.7 to 91.6 ms across the six runs
against the 92.2 ms on record. What does move in the logits is the single-row path's own run-to-run
spread, which is there without this change: two `master` runs of the same command differ by 0.0029 at
step 5, and the three arms span 0.0065 at the same step. `tests/test_qwen_hadamard_unfold.cpp` is
where the bit-exactness is actually established, on bytes rather than on logits.

The worker count is not a guess either. A one-run sweep on the final binary, again on the same
command line, four-rank mean of `model_load_seconds`:

| `QWEN_LOAD_THREADS` | 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| load | 63.7 s | 42.5 s | 31.0 s | 26.2 s | **23.1 s** | 23.6 s |

16 is the measured winner and is the shipped default. The curve is nearly flat past 8 and turns back
up at 32, where four ranks' pools oversubscribe the 44 cores.

**Where the ~23 s goes.** The last row and the worker-seconds below come from a temporary per-region
timer, added for one run and not in the shipped code. The three rows above it are the previous
record's numbers, because the change does not touch those regions and the arithmetic closes without
them moving: with the fan-out off the non-unfold load measures 65.4 − 43.8 = 21.5 s, against
122.6 − 101.0 = 21.6 s before it.

| What the ~23 s goes to | |
| --- | ---: |
| PTQ1_0 decode outside the unfold, 402 tensors | 11.5 s |
| Host resize of the 12.53 GiB destination | 4.4 s |
| Device upload, GGUF read and the rest | 4.6 s |
| Hadamard unfold, 128 tensors, 16 workers | **~2.7 s** |

The unfold is no longer the load's largest term, which is what this change was for. Its own shape,
summed over the workers so that it reads as work rather than as wall time — 43.4 worker-seconds over
the four ranks, or about 2.7 s of wall each:

| The unfold's 43 worker-seconds | |
| --- | ---: |
| Checkpoint read and the PTQ1_0 decode of the span | 3.7 s |
| fp16 → fp32 widening | 10.6 s |
| The butterfly | 11.8 s |
| fp32 → fp16 narrowing and the store | 17.3 s |

**Why the decode fell, and why it is no longer the whole story.** A trit is −1, 0 or 1 and a block's
scale is a finite fp16, so all 128 of a block's weights are one of exactly three fp16 values. The
narrowing — a branchy trit extraction plus a branchy software fp16 conversion, 128 times a block —
is therefore done three times, into a three-entry table, and each weight becomes a lookup. Two
properties of the packing are what make that a restructuring rather than a rewrite. The three
regions of `ptq1_0_trit_at` are each *a byte index cycling within a fixed width and a position
advancing once per cycle* (5 × 16, 5 × 8, 4 × 2), so writing them out as nested loops with the
position outer makes the byte index a constant offset in the innermost loop while preserving the
sequential 0…127 store order; and `(byte * pow3[stage])` truncated to `uint8_t` and then `(q * 3) >>
8` depends only on the byte and the position, so the trit is a 5 × 256 table. That table is *derived
from* `ptq1_0_trit_at` at static-init rather than written beside it, so the two cannot drift.

The one entry that is not obvious is zero. It must be `qwen_float_to_fp16_bits(0.0f * scale)` and not
a literal fp16 zero: a negative scale makes the product `-0.0f`, and the block reader's kernels store
that sign. `±scale` multiplies exactly, so the other two entries are `qwen_float_to_fp16_bits(-scale)`
and `qwen_float_to_fp16_bits(scale)`, and `tests/test_ptq1_0_decode.cpp` pins all three against an
independent scalar transcription of the format, on a device with no checkpoint and no vendor SDK.

**What the unfold was, and the two things that were wrong with it.** It is a TP4 consequence rather
than a packing one — a column-parallel shard that stops inside a 1024-element block cannot rotate its
own activation, so the weight is unfolded once at load — and it was paid per row, element by element
in fp32, on 128 tensors. Two properties of it were free to take, and they are what the 43
worker-seconds above now buy.

The transform is **blockwise along the last axis**: every element of output block `b` is a function of
input block `b` and of `signs[b * block …]` alone, so restricting the call to the blocks a shard
overlaps computes fewer blocks rather than different ones — same scale, same pass order, same signs at
the same global offsets. At TP4 that is 5 of `down_proj`'s 17 blocks and 2 of the 5 in
`out_proj`/`o_proj`, so about two thirds of what used to be transformed was discarded immediately
after being paid for. The butterfly falls from 39.4 s to 11.8 s for it, and the widening with it. The
span's two ends are rounded to a grain that is a whole number of transform blocks *and*, for this
block-packed source, of 128-weight packing blocks as well: the decode is blockwise too, and a span
that started inside a pack would take half of that pack's scale with it.

And **rows are independent and each writes a disjoint slice** of a destination no other row touches,
so they fan out over `QWEN_LOAD_THREADS` workers with no arithmetic consequence at all. Both are
properties of *which* blocks and *which* rows are visited, so neither can move a bit — which is what
the byte-level test holds them to, and why this is a restructuring rather than a tolerance.

**What the unfold did not need was a vectorized butterfly.** That was the next thing the previous
record proposed, and the measurement above says otherwise: the narrowing, at 17.3 s, is now the
largest single term in the unfold and untouched by either change, because it still runs over the
shard's `local_cols` and not over the span. It is also the one part that cannot be vectorized for
free — it has to reproduce a branchy routine bit for bit, subnormals and the sign of a
negative-scaled zero included, which is exactly what the three-entry table below avoided rather than
solved. What is left of the load now sits outside the unfold altogether, at
`copy_rows`/`copy_bytes` and the fp32 → fp16 narrowing the widening feeds.

The batched figure is gated, not just measured: the harness compares the batched path against a
synchronous single-row reference at three interleaved steps and checks both tokens and logits.

```bash
QWEN_BATCH_ROWS=16 QWEN_BATCH_VERIFY=3 scripts/run_qwen_ascend_tp4.sh "The capital of France is" 8
# verify_mismatches=0 verify_compared=48 batch_repeat_mismatches=0 seed_mismatches=0

# the bit-exactness claim above is a byte comparison, not a tolerance, and it needs
# no card: a synthetic GGUF, one tensor, materialized at the misaligned shards a
# 4-way split produces. It skips on a backend that reads the pack and never unfolds
source scripts/ascend_env.sh && scripts/build_ascend.sh
cpp_engine/build-ascend/tests/test_qwen_hadamard_unfold
# QWEN_LOAD_THREADS=1 runs the same case on the serial path; the test does it itself
```

## Correctness and what is not claimed

The generated text is the evidence that the container, the transform and the kernels compose: the
engine test generates `Paris. / The capital of Germany is Berlin. / The capital of Italy is Rome.`
from the released file, all 64 layers, greedy, and the per-kernel evidence — bit-exact integer dots
against the decoded blocks, the loader against the fork's own tiles — is in the earlier stages' pages
and on `tests/`.

Not claimed here: any quality or accuracy figure for the checkpoint (those belong to the authors'
evaluations), speculative decoding (MTP, DSpark and DFlash2 exist in this engine for the FP8
checkpoint and none was run against the ternary artifact), and TP > 1 **on CUDA**. The engine's TP4 is
what the FP8 sibling is served with, and the Ascend port above runs the ternary artifact at TP4, but
no multi-card CUDA run was made for it.

The alignment penalty is measured but not diagnosed. It is called out here so that the next person to
serve this checkpoint — or any checkpoint on this engine — does not measure a 4,097-token prompt and
conclude the model is slow.
