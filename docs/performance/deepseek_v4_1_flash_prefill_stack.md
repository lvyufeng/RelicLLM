# DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash: the three prefill optimizations, stacked

The [chunked-prefill page](deepseek_v4_1_flash_chunked_prefill.md) published the phase table of a
4096-token chunk at 32768 and named its three largest rows. The three passes that followed each took
one of them — [#296](https://github.com/lvyufeng/PocketLLM/pull/296) the sparse-attention score pass,
[#297](https://github.com/lvyufeng/PocketLLM/pull/297) the two grouped fp4 kernels' weight reads, and
[#298](https://github.com/lvyufeng/PocketLLM/pull/298) the reduction inside them — and each was
measured against the tree it was cut from. **This page is the composition instead of the parts:** one
arm on the 256K branch, one on the 256K branch with all three merged, the identical geometry, the
identical probe, all four ranks.

The chunk goes **65.94 → 48.48 s instrumented** and **56.87 → 38.07 s with the taps off (‑33.1%)**.
The three changes' own measured deltas — 5.33 s from #296's A/B, 8.98 s from #297's, 4.58 s from
#298's — add to 18.89 s against the 18.80 s measured here, so **they stack additively**: no overlap,
no interference, and the two that share a kernel launcher (#297 and #298) are independent in the
composition as well as in their own measurements. What the chunk is *made of* changes shape rather
than only shrinking. The sparse pass falls to a fifth of its former size and the grouped GEMM's two
kernels lose two thirds of theirs, while the expert H2D goes from 16.71 to 17.38 s — **the copies are
now 46% of the instrumented chunk and the largest single row in it**, and the third lever the
chunked-prefill page named is not the host's row loop, which this run measures at 1.52 s of 163,840
calls in both arms. The logits move and the decisions do not: the stacked tree picks the same token
as the base tree at all nine dump positions, and the stacked tree run twice is bit-identical.

The composition holds at the length the branch exists for, which is the other half of what this page
had to answer. Over a full 262144-token prompt the same two arms go **3722.8 → 2520.7 s and 70.4 →
104.0 tokens a second (1.477x)**, a 4096-token chunk going 58.17 → 39.39 s — and the ratio is 1.479x
on the chunk at the 32768 boundary and 1.476x on the last one, so none of the three levers is a term
that grows with the prefix. The two arms stage the same number of expert rows to within 1.8%, in the
direction that makes the stacked arm do *more* of the work.

**On the two binaries.** The control this page has is the tree, not a byte-identical extension: both
arms had their `cuda_kernel` rebuilt *after* their probe run, so the installed `.so` of each arm is
whatever was in place at 23:24 and 23:40 and is not in the payloads, and neither of the two md5s above
is the one #297 or #298 recorded for its own A/B — those were 9,490,256 and 9,416,528 bytes, against
12,709,712 and 12,853,624 here, the gap being the `.nv_fatbin` arch list rather than the kernels. What
makes the composition readable anyway is that the two trees differ in the Python as well, so "one
binary swapped" was never the design, and that the rows neither change touches — `attn.window`
0.81 → 0.82, `hc_mixes`/`hc_pre`/`hc_post`, `norm`, `engram` — agree across the arms to within 2%,
which is the shared code doing the same thing in both runs. The three changes' own A/Bs, in the
section below, were each taken on the tree they name.

## The chunk, both arms

Rank 0, seconds, `body` being the call between the tap's two barriers and `sync` the barriers
themselves. The column order in the payload is `[total, calls, sync, body]`; `total = body + sync`.
Nested rows are indented, and a nested row's `total` is contained in its parent's `body`.

| expert rows staged | 9,509 | 9,843 |
| peak allocated | 15.05 GiB | 15.12 GiB |

All four ranks report the same wall in both arms — 65.94/65.94/65.94/65.95 and
48.48/48.48/48.48/48.48 — with the identical taps-off chunk (56.87/56.86 and 38.07/38.06), and the
tables above are rank 0's; ranks 1 and 2 differ in where the same seconds sit, which is what the
per-rank `staged` column (9,509/9,516/5,029/5,020 against 9,843/9,918/5,106/5,042) is: the expert
split is 2/2/1/1 rows a layer, so ranks 2 and 3 stage half as much and their routed taps read
smaller.

Two reading notes that the `sync` column forces.

- **The instrument's own price is not constant across the arms.** The same 346,748-call tap costs
  10.41 s of the stacked chunk against 9.07 s of the base one, so the two instrumented walls are
  65.94 and 48.48 while the two *quiet* walls are 56.87 and 38.07. The quiet pair is the honest
  ratio: **‑33.1%**, against the instrumented pair's ‑26.5%, which is a floor.
- **The `routed.issue` row's columns move between the arms and its total does not stay put.** In the
  base chunk the tap's postamble is the grouped GEMM and it reads 17.61 s of `sync` against 0.57 s of
  `body`; in the stacked chunk those are 0.25 and 5.24. The function is byte-identical between the two
  trees — `diff` of the extracted `_issue_chunk` is empty — so what moved is what it waits on: with
  the kernels three times faster, the issue path's own time is the host's launches and the
  `wait_stream` on the copy stream it depends on, not the GEMM. The **sum** of the two columns is the
  number to compare across arms: 18.18 against 5.49.

## Where the 18.80 quiet seconds went

The three passes' own A/Bs, the base each was taken against, and what the composition here reads.
Each delta is the other page's, measured on the real checkpoint at this same geometry:

| change | its own A/B | its delta | the row it lands in, here |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| #296, the sparse score pass as a warp dot | 56.88 → 51.55 s | ‑5.33 | `attn.sparse` 8.07 → 1.98 (‑6.09 total) |
| #297, the two fp4 kernels' weight reads coalesced | 56.49 → 47.51 s | ‑8.98 | `routed.issue` 18.18 → 5.49 (‑12.69 total) |
| #298, the reduction grouped per token into a CSR | 51.46 → 46.88 s | ‑4.58 | the same row: #297's two kernels go 13.72 → 4.44 s of its own device table, and this finishes the reduction inside the second |
| the three added | | **‑18.89** | measured here: **‑18.80** on the quiet chunk |

The last row is the point of the page. The deltas are taken against three different bases — #296
against the 256K branch, #297 against `master`-based kernels inside the 256K worktree, #298 against
the tree with #296 already in it — so their sum is a prediction that only holds if the three do not
interact, and it holds to **0.1 s in 18.8**, five parts in a thousand. The one interaction worth
looking for is between #297 and #298, which are stacked: #297 widens the token tile and stages the
weights through shared, #298 changes the reduction the second kernel does afterwards, and the two
touch the same launcher and the same two symbols. Their being additive says the reduction loop #298
replaced was not covered by anything #297 did, which its own page claims by construction (the CSR is
a different loop over the same pairs) and this page confirms by measurement.

The third row of the table is where the two differ in kind rather than in size. `attn.sparse` is a
single kernel whose 8.06 s of measured device time becomes 1.97; `routed.issue` is a *path* whose
total time more than triples its own kernels' improvement, because the 12.69 s it loses is not all
kernel time — 9.28 s of it is #297's two kernels and the rest is the reduction and the host's share
of the launch loop, which is only exposed once the card stops being the limit.

## What the chunk is made of now

Attributing the quiet chunk's 38.07 s out of the measured device rows:

| row | base, device | stacked, device | share of the stacked quiet chunk |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| expert H2D into the arena (`routed.upload`'s sync, 170.5 GiB at ~12 GB/s) | 14.37 | 15.02 | **39%** |
| the grouped fp4 GEMM (`routed.issue`'s sync, base) | 17.61 | ≤4.4 | ~12% |
| sparse attention | 8.06 | 1.97 | 5% |
| the TP combine at the end of `MoE.forward` (`moe`'s own sync) | 2.86 | 2.95 | 8% |
| the rest of the measured device time (window, indexer, hc, norm, engram, gate, shared) | 8.56 | 8.55 | 22% |
| the routed path's own host bodies (see below) | 5.11 | 5.11 | 13% |

Three things follow.

- **The lever has moved to the bytes.** 15.02 s of H2D is now the largest single row, and it is not a
  kernel: it is 170 GiB of expert rows crossing PCIe 3.0 at the 12 GB/s this host measures, 8,978
  calls of ~19 MiB. #297's own docstring says so about its own change — "the staged rows are the same,
  so what moved is the call count and not the floor" — and with the kernels out of the way the floor
  is what is left. The reduction that would move it is the number of rows a chunk stages, which is
  the same lever the [chunked-prefill page](deepseek_v4_1_flash_chunked_prefill.md) prices at 1.51 ms
  a row and the pool width at 148 rows.
- **The host's row bookkeeping is not the third lever.** The chunked-prefill page read a 6.7–9.5 s
  band off `_resolve_row`'s row of its table and attributed it to the per-row Python loop at 20–29 µs
  a call over 327,680 calls. The barrier split says that row's `body` is **1.52 s over 163,840 calls
  in the base chunk, 1.52 s in the stacked chunk, and 1.52–1.55 s in the base warm-up's eight chunks**
  — four independent 163,840-call groups agreeing to 2%, the cleanest one-instance measurement in
  this run — so its 7.00 s row is 1.52 s of loop, ~2.0 s of the probe's own two barriers, and the
  balance a wait on H2D issued by `_stage_misses`. What the routed path spends on the host is its
  *bodies*, and they sum to 5.11 s: `_upload` 2.34 s over 8,634 calls (271 µs a call), the per-row
  loop 1.52 s, `DeviceRoutedExperts.forward`'s own glue 1.97 s, `_issue_chunk` 0.57 s,
  `_drain_chunk` 0.34 s, `_stage_misses` own 0.13 s. The per-row loop is 30% of it, and the shim the
  chunked-prefill page built prices the floor of that loop at 4.6 µs a call — 0.75 s of the 1.52 —
  so the row loop is worth at most 1.4% of a chunk, against the copies' 39%. (That page's band is
  corrected in place.)
- **The TP combine has become visible, and it is not a bandwidth row.** `MoE.forward`'s own postamble
  is 2.95 s of the stacked chunk over 40 calls — 73.8 ms a layer, 8%, larger than the sparse pass now
  that the sparse pass is a fifth of what it was — and nothing in it is a kernel this pass touched: it
  is `tp.reduce` at the end of the MoE (`modules.py:485`). The tap that saw it is a host sync over the
  whole postamble, and the profiler that separated the collectives underneath it keyed them **by
  name**, which merged this one with the attention's `wo_b` combine (`attention.py:1166`): both are
  `tp.reduce` over a `[4096, 5120]` activation, both call `make_all_reduce`, which widens to fp32
  before reducing, so both are the same **80.00 MiB fp32** once a layer — and merged they read 80
  calls at 52.28 ms a call. Keyed by the *chain* the scope sits in, they are two rows of 40 calls each
  and they are not the same cost:

  | 80.00 MiB fp32, 40 calls a rank | rank 0 | rank 1 | rank 2 | rank 3 |
  | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
  | under `v41.Attn.forward` | 18.2 ms a call | 19.8 | 13.2 | 16.4 |
  | under `v41.MoE.forward` | 86.4 ms a call | 74.0 | 347.0 | 352.0 |

  The attention's row is the message. An isolated all-reduce of the same 80 MiB on this fabric, cards
  otherwise idle and event-timed a call (`/tmp/probe_allreduce_rate.py`, median of 100), is **13.58 ms
  at 5.75 GiB/s**, on the same curve as the same probe's 32 MiB (5.46 ms, 5.72 GiB/s) and 1 MiB
  (0.193 ms, 5.07 GiB/s) rows — and the attention site costs that on all four ranks, which is what a
  message with four ranks that arrive together looks like. The pairs do differ there — the two PHB
  ranks pay 18.2 and 19.8 ms where the two NV2 ranks pay 13.2 and 16.4 — but by 6 ms and not by 266,
  and the attention is TP-sharded work every rank does in full, so there is nothing for it to be
  waiting on. The MoE's row is not the message: it is
  5.4x to 26x that floor, and it is **inverted against the expert load**, which is what says what it
  is. The `sorted` deal is static and round-robin over the six sorted routed ids
  (`device_experts.py:29-42`) — it is what this page's sitting ran, being the default at the time and
  one flag off it since — so ranks 0 and 1 own two of the six slots and ranks 2 and 3 one, which
  is 2x the rows staged — 606,192 against 321,354 over the 256K leg — and 1.8x the routed path
  (`MoE.routed` 17.163 and 17.395 s on ranks 0 and 1 against 9.362 and 9.262 on ranks 2 and 3, over
  the same 40 layers). Those are the ranks that reach the reduce *last* and wait *least*; the two that
  did half the work hold the collective for 347-352 ms a layer. The row is a rendezvous with two
  ranks' expert paths, not a transfer.

  Two things follow, and the second is why this is recorded rather than fixed. A bf16 reduce is
  attractive here — the source activation is 41.9 MiB and the wire carries 80 — and it would take the
  message from 13.58 ms to **7.08 ms** (the same probe's bf16 row, the same 41.9 MiB), which is 0.26 s
  off a 38.07 s chunk: **0.7%**. It would take *nothing* off the row that carries the 2.95 s, because
  that row is not the bytes. What would move it is even expert work, and under `sorted` — six slots
  dealt over four cards — there is no split below a 2, 2, 1, 1 one: `ceil(topk / world)` is the arena
  every card was sized for there (`device_experts.py:643`), and a deal that rotated per row would make
  every card own every expert over a pass, which is the per-layer resident set this branch's 2.6-2.7x
  is about. **The deal that does balance it is `id`**, which partitions the experts themselves over the
  cards instead of dealing each card a slice of every row, and it is the default now — it is worth
  1.42x on this same 262144 length, priced [on the expert
  page](deepseek_v4_1_flash_device_experts.md#the-same-pair-re-taken-on-the-tree-that-ships-149x-and-142x),
  at four more arena rows a card. Under `sorted` the straggler is the floor, and reading the other row
  as the floor would have sent a bf16 kernel after 0.7% of a chunk.

## The same composition at 256K

Every number above is one 4096-token chunk at 32768, which is the geometry the three passes were
developed against. But the branch the composition sits on is the 256K branch, and a lever worth 33% of
a chunk at 32768 is not automatically worth 33% of a chunk at 262144 — of the two terms the
[chunked-prefill page](deepseek_v4_1_flash_chunked_prefill.md) separates, the expert path is linear in
the tokens and the indexer's prefix scoring is linear in the tokens *times the prefix width*, so a
composition can hold at 32768 and thin out at 256K. So both arms were re-run over a full
262144-token prompt, one leg each, `--lengths 262144 --chunk 4096 --pool-rows 148 --buffers 2
--threads 22`, with `--max-seq-len` left at the leg's own 262208 so the caches are the 256K ones
rather than the 41024 the tables above ran against.

| expert rows staged, rank 0 | 606,192 (2.31 a token) | 616,825 (2.35 a token) |
| expert rows staged, rank 3 | 321,864 (1.23 a token) | 324,553 (1.24 a token) |
| top-8 at 262144, all four ranks | `[295, 1, 6273, 1000, 14, 16, 270, 509]` | `[295, 1, 1000, 6273, 14, 270, 509, 16]` |

**The ratio is flat.** 1.479x on the chunk at the 32768 boundary, 1.476x on the last chunk, 1.477x
over the whole leg. That is the useful negative result as much as the positive one: none of the three
levers is a term that grows with the prefix, so none of them is what the next pass at this length
should be looking at. The saving the 32768 profile measured, 18.80 s, is 18.37 s on the chunk at that
same boundary here and 19.65 s on the last one — a drift of about a second across the leg, which is
the size of the fit's own residual below and not a trend the endpoints resolve.

The two trees are the two above, one commit further on. `/tmp/pr_b` is the 256K branch at `4608981`,
which is `98e828f` — the tip the 22-tap profile ran — plus two Markdown files; `/tmp/prefill_all` is
`b7f633a`, which is `98e828f` plus the three merges. So the arms differ in the Python and in the
kernels by the three changes and in nothing else, and the documentation delta between them is one
page's corrections, which cannot move a chunk.

**This leg's 32768-token chunk is the chunk above.** Chunk 9 of the leg is `[32768:36864]`, the same
chunk the 22-tap profile ran, and the two arms come back within 0.8% of it — 56.72 s against 56.87 s
in the base arm, 38.35 against 38.07 in the stacked one. The two arms here are therefore the two arms
there, read at a longer prompt; and since the caches are 262208 wide here against 41024 there, the
wider allocation costs nothing at a 32768-token prefix.

**The stacked arm stages more expert rows, not fewer.** Rank 0 goes 606,192 → 616,825, which is +1.8%;
rank 1 +1.4%, rank 3 +0.8%. That is the direction the 32768 profile's expert H2D row went too (16.71 →
17.38 s), and for the same reason: the three kernels reorder fp32 accumulation, the router's argmax
moves with it, and a few more of the expert ids a pass draws miss the pool. 1.8% more staging inside a
chunk that is 32% shorter is what says none of the 18.8 s is saved rows. The 2/2/1/1 deal is in the
row counts unchanged — 2.31-2.35 rows a token on ranks 0 and 1 against 1.23-1.24 on ranks 2 and 3,
against the 2.37 the chunked-prefill page measured for the same 148-row pool.

**Those row counts are the `sorted` deal's, and the deal is a lever this length has priced twice
over.** 2.31-2.35 rows a token on the ranks dealt two of a row's six sorted slots against
1.23-1.24 on the two dealt one is that deal's imbalance read straight off the counters — the deal
walks each card's columns across the whole expert range, so a card dealt two slots stages about twice
the draws *and* about twice the distinct experts of a card dealt one. Dealing a drawing by expert id
instead partitions the experts themselves and removes the imbalance: on this same 262144-token leg, on
the tree these two arms are cut from but **without** the three changes, `/tmp/run_deal_256k.sh`
measured **3121.0 s and 83.99 tok/s against 3701.0 s and 70.83 — 1.19x — at 0.53 staged rows a token
against 2.31 and the four ranks' spread 1.91x to 1.02x**, for four more arena rows a card and +0.04
GiB of peak. It is [priced on the expert page](deepseek_v4_1_flash_device_experts.md#the-deal-is-a-choice-and-dealing-ids-instead-of-positions-balances-the-staged-set),
and that price is the tree **without** these three changes, so it is not what the deal is worth on top
of them; the re-take that is is [the same page's last
subsection](deepseek_v4_1_flash_device_experts.md#the-same-pair-re-taken-on-the-tree-that-ships-149x-and-142x),
`/tmp/run_deal_256k_master.sh`, both arms of one sitting on the shipping tree: **2532.75 s to 1789.92 s
and 103.50 to 146.46 tok/s, 1.41x**, at 3.41x fewer staged rows, +0.39 GiB allocated on the worst card
and +0.04 GiB reserved. Its `sorted` arm is this page's stacked arm read again — 39.57 s a chunk
against 39.39 s here, 0.5% apart through a different probe — which is what lets the two ratios be put
end to end: **1.477x and 1.415x make 2.080 against 2.080 measured**, this page's 3722.8 s base arm to
1789.92 s. The deal's own share of that rose from 1.19x to 1.42x when these three landed under it, and
that is the part worth keeping: the two are not the same term. The three changes leave the staged-row
slope where they found it (+1.8% on rank 0) and buy their 1.477x in the compute, while the deal buys
its 1.42x by taking rows a token off the slope.

**Both arms grow by the same 5.2 s across the leg.** From chunk 5 to chunk 64 — a prefix of 16384
against one of 262144 — the base arm's chunk goes 55.70 → 60.91 s (+5.21) and the stacked arm's
36.00 → 41.26 (+5.26). Fitted over the sixteen sampled chunks that is 0.0206 ms a token for the base
arm and 0.0173 for the stacked one with worst residuals of 1.15 and 1.12 s, so the two slopes are not
resolved apart and the endpoints are the same seconds. The prefix-dependent part of a 256K chunk is
therefore ~5.2 s of the stacked arm's 41.26 — 13% of it — and it is the part the three changes leave
alone. Which phase that is in is not something this probe has a tap for; the two candidates the
chunked-prefill page names for a context-growing term are the indexer's prefix scoring and its `topk`
over the group count. The first chunk of each leg is separately dear — 64.47 s against a fitted 55.28
in the base arm, 47.73 against 36.84 in the stacked one — which is 0.25% and 0.43% of the two legs,
paid once and in both arms.

**And all four ranks agree on every chunk.** The seventeen printed chunks are one number each rather
than four: outside chunk 1 the ranks report the same seconds to 0.01 s, and inside it they spread 0.84 s
in the base arm and 0.56 s in the stacked one, which is the warm-up. So no part of the wall is a
straggler that one rank sees and another does not — the layer-level split the section above measured
lives inside a chunk, and eighty collectives a layer is enough to re-lock the ranks before the chunk
ends.

**The logits at 256K.** Both arms return the same eight tokens and the same next token, 295, on all
four ranks; the difference is the order. 6273 and 1000 swap places, and 16 drops from sixth to last,
so at this position the fourth to eighth logits sit within about 0.5 of each other — against the
0.33-0.67 mean `|diff|` the parity suite measured at 32768, where the top-2 gap stands at 9.10-13.64.
That is the same perturbation landing on a position whose tail happens to be tight rather than a new
one, and it does not move the decision. What this run compares is the top-8 and not the matrix — the
probe prints `topk(logits, 8)` where the parity suite dumps all 129280 columns — so it is the same
token and the same eight candidates, not bit-equality, and a permutation below the eighth place would
not be visible in it.

**On naming the arms.** The stacked arm's log names the tree it loaded, on all four ranks —
`tree /tmp/prefill_all/src/__init__.py` — and the base arm's does not: the `say` that prints it was
added to the probe at 01:30:41, eleven minutes after that arm's hour began, so the running process had
already imported `src` from a file that did not yet contain the line. Its identity is not idle
curiosity, since the probe's `sys.path` order is what the first attempt at this A/B got wrong and
would go wrong silently; it is established two other ways instead. The repository checkout that
`V41_TREE` displaces has no `chunk` argument on `LoadedBackbone.__call__` (`loader.py:720`) while
`/tmp/pr_b` at `4608981` does, and the probe passes `chunk=None` on every chunk, so an arm that
finished all 64 of them cannot be the checkout — the earlier attempt died on the first chunk exactly
so, and that death is what the `sys.path` order on the page above was written for. And its numbers are
the base arm's: 56.72 s at the 32768 boundary against the 56.87 s the profile above measured, and
70.4 tok/s over the leg against the 3711.0 s / 70.6 tok/s the
[chunked-prefill page](deepseek_v4_1_flash_chunked_prefill.md) published for this tree at this length,
0.4%.

## The logits

`/tmp/pr_b_parity.py` dumps the last-position logits after every chunk — nine positions from 4096 to
36864, 129,280 entries each — and it was run three times through `/tmp/parity_stack.sh`: the base
tree, the stacked tree, and the stacked tree again. The third arm is the control, and it comes back
**bit-identical over all nine positions on all four ranks, worst `max |diff| = 0.000e+00`**. There is
no host-side nondeterminism in this run to discount, so base against stacked is the three kernel
changes and nothing else.

| | base against stacked | stacked against stacked again |
| --- | --- | --- |
| positions with the same argmax | 9 of 9, every rank | 9 of 9, every rank |
| bit-identical positions | 0 of 9 | **9 of 9** |
| worst `max \|diff\|` | 4.564e+00, at 8192 | 0.000e+00 |
| `max \|logit\|` there | 25.28 | 25.28 |
| top-2 gap there | 12.162 | 12.162 |

The perturbation is not rounding dust. The mean `|diff|` across the vocabulary is 0.33–0.67 at the
nine positions against a largest logit of 25.3–27.9, so the distribution moves by a fiftieth of its
own scale — which is what reordering fp32 accumulation through forty layers, a router and an expert
pool does, and the same shape the [chunked-prefill
page](deepseek_v4_1_flash_chunked_prefill.md) reported when it localized its own first difference to
layer 0's gate and routed experts. What it does not do is move the decision. The gap between the top
two logits is 9.10 to 13.64 at the nine positions, standing at **2.7× to 6.0×** the worst
perturbation there — 12.162 against 4.564 at 8192, the tightest of the nine — and the argmax is the
same on both trees at every one of them. Nine decisions out of nine is a weak test on nine positions,
and it is the test this run has.

Two footnotes. Every rank writes the same nine rows, byte for byte, in all three arms: the expert
split is reduced back to one activation per layer, and the four cards agree to the bit, which is why
the log repeats the same comparison four times. And the arms' walls agree with the profile to the
second — the base arm's nine chunks are 65.23 s for the first and 55.2–56.9 for the rest, the stacked
arm's 38.5 — so the run that produced these logits is the run this page's tables describe.

## Reproducing

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_V41_RESIDENT_EXPERTS=1
# the base arm, on the 256K branch
V41_TREE=/tmp/pr_b /home/lvyufeng/miniconda3/envs/deepseek/bin/torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 \
    /tmp/probe_v41_chunk_profile_host.py --at 32768 --chunk 4096 --max-seq-len 41024 \
    --pool-rows 148 --buffers 2 --threads 22 --out /tmp/chunk_profile_base
# the stacked arm, on 98e828f with the three merges
V41_TREE=/tmp/prefill_all /home/lvyufeng/miniconda3/envs/deepseek/bin/torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 \
    /tmp/probe_v41_chunk_profile_host.py --at 32768 --chunk 4096 --max-seq-len 41024 \
    --pool-rows 148 --buffers 2 --threads 22 --out /tmp/chunk_profile_all
```

The stacked tree is the three branches merged onto `feature/v41-256k-context`, which is what
`perf/v41-prefill-integration-256k` is:

```bash
git checkout -b perf/v41-prefill-integration-256k feature/v41-256k-context
git merge perf/v41-prefill-sparse-attn-warp-dot
git merge perf/v41-moe-multi-coalesced-weights
git merge perf/v41-moe-reduce-csr
```

`--out X` writes `X.r0` … `X.r3`, one a rank; the parity arms are `/tmp/pr_b_parity.py` with the same
`--at/--chunk/--pool-rows/--max-seq-len`, and `--compare a b` reads two of its dumps back.

The 256K leg is the same two trees through a different probe, one leg each, with the rendezvous port
given a moment between the runs — the port is released by the process and not by its exit, which is
how an earlier attempt at a back-to-back pair came back `EADDRINUSE` and reported success:

```bash
for arm in base:/tmp/pr_b stacked:/tmp/prefill_all; do
    name="${arm%%:*}"; tree="${arm#*:}"
    V41_TREE="$tree" /home/lvyufeng/miniconda3/envs/deepseek/bin/torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 \
        /tmp/probe_v41_chunk_scaling.py --lengths 262144 --chunk 4096 --pool-rows 148 \
        --buffers 2 --threads 22 --out "/tmp/chunk_scaling_$name.pt"
    sleep 20
done
```

`DEEPSEEK_V41_RESIDENT_EXPERTS=1` in the environment as above, and the probe says which tree each arm
resolved to — `tree /tmp/prefill_all/src/__init__.py` — which is worth watching for, because the two
`sys.path` inserts in it (`probe_v41_chunk_scaling.py:38-40`) only put a `V41_TREE` in front of the
repository checkout if the tree's insert is second; written the other way round both arms quietly
measure this checkout instead.
