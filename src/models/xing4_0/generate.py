"""Xing4.0-29B-A4B's generation loop: a prompt in, tokens and their cost out.

The trunk's forward is one call that consumes whichever tokens it is handed
(``gguf_model.forward``), so a decode step is that call with one token and a
prefill is the same call with a chunk.  What this module adds is the loop around
it -- the sampler, the end-of-turn set, the chunk boundary and the clocks -- and
it is separate from `pocketllm`'s adapters for the reason the other models'
loops are: the numbers a request reports and the way a cancel reaches it are the
same questions whatever is serving them.

The cache is the caller's.  It is 46 KB a token across the forty layers, so a
262144-position run is 11.8 GiB and a service allocates it once and resets it per
request rather than paying the zeroing every time.

Stage 5 of [#388](https://github.com/lvyufeng/PocketLLM/issues/388).

score matrix in fp32 -- 4 GiB for one layer -- where eight 4K chunks are eight
smaller ones with the same answer.  It is also the width the rate was measured
