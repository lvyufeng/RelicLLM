"""Xing4.0-29B-A4B's MLA attention, in both of the forms its two releases imply.

The checkpoint ships the same attention twice.  Its own remote code
(`modeling_xing4_0.py`) is the **expanded** form: `kv_b_proj` up-projects the
512-wide latent to `num_heads * (qk_nope + v_head_dim)` and the cache holds
32 heads x (192 + 128) per token.  Its released GGUF is the **absorbed** form: it
carries `attn_k_b` and `attn_v_b` as separate tensors and its
`attention.head_count_kv` is 1, so the cache holds one 512-wide latent and its
64-wide shared rotary key.  This module writes both, because the parity test is
only meaningful against the first and the engine wants the second.

What was reused, and what could not be:

- **Reused**: `glm_dsa`'s MLA skeleton.  The GGUF tensor names are identical
  (`attn_kv_a_mqa`, `attn_k_b`, `attn_v_b`, `attn_output`), and so are the
  orientations -- `k_b` is `[qk_nope, kv_lora, heads]` and `v_b` is
  `[kv_lora, v_head, heads]`, which is what `src/models/glm_dsa/architecture.py`
  already sums against.  The einsums below are that file's, with this
  checkpoint's numbers.
- **Not reusable**: the rotary embedding.  `glm_dsa` reads interleaved pairs and
  writes them back interleaved; this checkpoint reads interleaved pairs and
  writes the two halves contiguously, and it is YaRN rather than plain RoPE.
  See `src/models/xing4_0/rope.py`.
- **Not reusable**: the attention scale.  `1/sqrt(192)`, then multiplied by the
  YaRN magnitude scale *squared* -- `1.4159 ** 2` for this config.  `glm_dsa`
  uses `1/sqrt(key_mla_dim)` and nothing else.
- **Not reusable**: the decode path.  `glm_dsa` expands per token; the absorbed
  form below is what the released file is shaped for.

## The absorbed form, and what absorbing costs

Absorption folds the up-projections into the attention rather than the cache:

    score[h] = (W_kb[h]^T q_nope[h]) . c  +  q_rope . k_rope
    out[h]   = (softmax(score)[h] . c) @ W_vb[h]

which is the same arithmetic as the expanded form, re-associated.  It is what
makes the cache 576 elements per token per layer instead of 32 x 320, i.e. 17.8x
smaller, and the price is that the query has to be absorbed once per token, which
widens it from 32 x 192 = 6144 to 32 x 512 = 16384.  At decode that is one
small GEMM against the cache being read at a seventeenth of the width, so it
pays; at prefill it does not, which is why both are here.

One detail is worth stating because it is where an absorbed port diverges: the
rope key is *shared across heads* in both forms.  `kv_a_proj` produces one
64-wide `k_rope`, RoPE rotates it once, and the expanded form then broadcasts it
with `.expand(...)`.  A port that ropes it per head still gets the right answer
if the rotation is identical -- but a port that ropes the *latent* instead of the
rope key, or that folds the rope dimension into the 512-wide latent's dot
product, does not.

    is the *fastest-varying* axis, so a tensor the header lists as `[3584, 768]`
    is 768 rows of 3584 in memory.  The three-dimensional ones keep the head axis
    first, for the same reason: the header's `[128, 512, 32]` is `(32, 512, 128)`
    in memory.

    `k_b` and `v_b` are the absorbed halves of `kv_b_proj`: the GGUF ships them
    split so that an absorbed runtime never has to build the (512, 8192)
    concatenation the reference's `kv_b_proj` is.  Their `(out, in)` orientation
    is the absorbed one -- `k_b[h]` is `(kv_lora, qk_nope)` and applies to a
    query, `v_b[h]` is `(v_head, kv_lora)` and applies to the latent -- and the
    non-absorbed form reads the same tensors transposed, which is a contraction
    order and not a different weight.

    `tokens` is the width the cache was *read* at, and on the bucketed and captured paths it is wider

    the reason a bucket is legal at all: `k_pos > pos` hides the rows past the position, and `pos` is
    a 0-dim tensor there, which is a comparison a capture can hold.

    On the host path at the cache's own length the decode mask hides nothing — every row from 0 to
    `pos` is a row the step may see — and `masked_fill` with an all-false mask returns its input
    bit for bit.  So the rule is applied unconditionally rather than branched on, which is what makes
    a bucketed eager step and a captured one differ in their submission and in nothing else.
