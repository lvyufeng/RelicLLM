"""Xing4.0-29B-A4B, end to end, out of the published IQ4_NL GGUF.

The whole checkpoint is 18.7 GiB, so this is the first model in the repository
that fits on one 2080 Ti with room left over -- and the way the weights are held
follows from that rather than from the architecture.  Three kinds of tensor and
three treatments:

- **Raw IQ4_NL blocks, run in place.**  The routed experts (14.7 GiB) and the two
  leading dense blocks' MLPs.  Nothing is dequantized: the blocks go to the card
  and the kernels consume them there, which is what keeps the checkpoint's size
  and its resident footprint the same number.
- **Resident bf16, cast to fp16.**  The attention path is 2.117 GiB of bf16 in
  the file and the card has no bf16 tensor cores, so it is cast once at load.
  This is also the byte table's other half: the attention, not the MoE, is what a
  decode step reads most of.
- **fp32, kept as fp32.**  Every norm, the router, and the hyper-connections'
  gates, which the quantizer excludes by name as precision-sensitive.

What is deliberately not here: the NextN block at `blk.40`.  It is a
speculative head, the repository has its own history with MTP, and serving
without it changes no number this stage records.

Stage 5 of [#388](https://github.com/lvyufeng/PocketLLM/issues/388).
