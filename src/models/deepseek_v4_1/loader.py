"""Feed the released DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash shards into `modules.Backbone`.

`modules.py` builds the tree over `torch.empty` and `src/loader/safetensors.py` maps the 48 shards;
this is the one place that knows which name in the file is which parameter in the tree, and the one
place that knows which of them are quantized. `checkpoint_weights` is the general half -- it walks a
module's own parameter names and copies the same-named tensor in -- and the two `Checkpoint*` classes
are the specific half, for the two things the checkpoint holds in a shape the tree does not.

Four properties of the release decide the shape of this file. All four are measured from the shards
rather than read off the reference, because the reference's own loader runs against a *converted*
checkpoint (`inference/convert.py` rewrites the fp4 experts and splits the model across ranks) and so
never has to decide any of them:

* **Quantization is not a config field, so it is detected per tensor.** A weight is quantized exactly
  when a tensor with the same stem and a `scale` leaf sits beside it: 162.0M elements of dense
  projection per layer arrive fp8 -- 126.6M of that attention, the rest the shared experts -- the 384
  experts arrive as packed fp4, and the norms, the gates, the hyper-connection coefficients and the
  embedding arrive plain. `cfg.dtype` says `'fp8'` and `cfg.expert_dtype` says `'fp4'`, but no layer
  stores its `compressor.wkv` fp8 -- all four KV sources store it bf16, and the tree then holds layer
  20's bf16 and the other three fp32, because `Compressor` builds that one in the parameter dtype
  only when `compress_ratio` is 1 -- so the config's dtype is a statement about the model and not a
  lookup key.
* **The scale beside a weight comes in two layouts, and which one applies follows from the dtype.**
  A dense fp8 weight's scale is a two-dimensional `[out // 32, in // 32]` grid -- `wq_a`'s is
  `(40, 160)` for a `(1280, 5120)` weight -- while a packed fp4 expert's and an Engram table's keep a
  row per output row along K only (`(2304, 160)` beside `(2304, 2560)`, and `(rows, 8)` beside
  `(rows, 256)`). Both put the block structure along K, so `block_size` is derived the same way from
  either and holds for the release's 32; the axis a scale is *expanded* along does not, and
  `kernels.dequant_fp8_weight` versus `dequantize_rows` is that difference.
* **`compressor.wgate` exists on three of the four KV source layers, not four.** `compress_ratios[20]`
  is 1, and `Compressor.__init__` returns before creating `wgate` in that case, so layer 20 has
  `compressor.norm` and `compressor.wkv` and no `wgate`. Nothing in the loader has to special-case it
  -- the name simply is not there and the tree does not ask for it -- but it is the reason a naive
  "40 layers times 4 KV sources" key count comes up one short. The same `ratio <= 1` branch is why the
  tree keeps layer 20's `compressor.wkv` bf16 while layers 2, 8 and 14 hold fp32 there: 176 of the 924
  parameters are bf16 in the file and fp32 in the tree -- the four norms on every layer, the
  compressor's norm, `wgate` and `wkv` on the ratio-2 KV sources, the indexer's `k_norm`, the root
  `norm` and `head` -- and `checkpoint_weights` casts each into its parameter's own dtype rather than
  special-casing any of them.
* **Neither Engram table belongs anywhere but host RAM, and gathering from the shards is not an
  option either.** They are 91.55 and 91.56 GiB of rows, and a forward touches one row per hash
  column -- 24 per position, per table -- so `CheckpointEngramTable` either copies the table into RAM
  (189.1 GiB of codes and scales for both) or gathers each row out of the mapping. The gather is what
  decides it, and it is a page-cache question rather than a bandwidth one: measured on a quiet disk,
  a row whose page is not yet resident costs **21 to 49 ms** out of the mapping -- one seek per row on
  this shingled drive, the low end when a batch of them queues up behind each other -- and the same
  row costs **0.004 ms** once it is. A 512-token prefill gathers 12,288 rows per table, which measured
  **253 s** from a cold cache, where the same rows out of the copy take **9 ms**. The copy is one
  sequential pass -- **373 s** per table here, 271 MiB/s, and 747 s for both -- and it is paid once.
  Both paths gather through a `uint8` alias because the CPU has no
  float8 `index_select`: `view[rows]` raises `NotImplementedError: "index_cpu" not implemented for
  'Float8_e4m3fn'` and the E8M0 scales raise it too.
* **The three DSpark draft layers, the vision tower and the aligner are simply not asked for.**
  `Backbone` is the text backbone, so 94,831 of the checkpoint's 96,085 tensors are left where they
  are, and 92,160 of those are the expert projections. `LoadReport.unloaded_groups` counts 95,161
  rather than 94,831 because it tallies a quantized name as the one tensor it is named by and not as
  the two it reads; either way it counts them rather than passing over them in silence.

`checkpoint_weights` raises on a parameter it could not fill. That is deliberate: every module in the
tree is built out of `torch.empty`, so a parameter the checkpoint does not name stays uninitialized
memory, and uninitialized memory that happens to be finite is not detectable at the point of use.

    Not an `nn.Module`, deliberately: a module would put its weights in `state_dict()` and in
    `parameters()`, and the point of this class is that the layer's experts are *not* part of the
    tree. `MoE` holds one of these where `ResidentRoutedExperts` would hold a bank, so the backbone
    has no `ffn.routed.*` tensor to fill and the 476 GiB never becomes an allocation.

    A miss reads the expert's three matrices out of the mapping and expands them to bf16, which is
    the same width the resident bank holds and the width `expert_forward` consumes. bf16 and not
    fp32: the released fp4 is four bits of mantissa, so bf16's eight are already more than the
    expansion can recover, and the cache below is what makes the cost per miss bearable.

    It barely does. A token routes to 6 of the layer's 384 experts, so a 16-expert window returns
    about half of them: measured over four decode steps, 119 of 240 expert rows missed, warm, and
    759 of 1,200 at a five-token prefill (`/tmp/probe_token_cost.py`). That is half a step's
    expansions saved for the 42 GiB the window costs across the backbone, and it puts the whole
    model's token time on the expansion rather than on the disk -- one miss is 0.3% mapping read and
    99.7% the arithmetic that turns fp4 codes into fp32 and then bf16, at 0.122 s per expert, so a
    step that misses all 240 of a token's experts costs about 29 s and the 119 a warm step misses
    about 14.5 s, against 1.0 s for a forward whose experts are already expanded and 27.2 s for a
    first, entirely cold one. 240 fresh experts is 4.2 GiB read and 15.8 GiB expanded per token, on
    a host whose RAM holds all 269 GiB of them in their packed form and hands them over for free;
    what the host cannot do cheaply is turn them into numbers. A device-side cache is what replaces
    it, not a larger `cache_size`.

    24 per position, two tables -- so the question is not whether the table fits but what a gather
    costs. Out of the mapping it is one seek per row, and on the shingled disk this checkpoint lives
    on that is expensive enough to decide how the model is served: measured 21 to 49 ms for a row
    whose page is not resident, against 0.004 ms for one that is. A 512-token prefill gathers 12,288
    rows per table, so a cold one is 253 s per table and a corpus would keep paying that as it moved
    onto new n-grams, where the same 12,288 rows out of the copy take 9 ms.

    So `resident` is not a tuning knob but a choice of when to pay, and the answer is not close. A
    real run sets it and pays one sequential pass -- measured 373 s per table, 747 s for both, at 271
    MiB/s -- from which every later gather is a memcpy out of a 91.6 GiB array. The host has the room:
    189.1 GiB of codes and scales against the 930 GiB this machine reports available. The streaming
    path exists for a host that cannot spare the memory, and for a test that wants the two to be
    comparable. It is not wrong, it is just cold on every n-gram it has not seen before.

    Dequantization is `modules.dequantize_rows`, the same function `ResidentEngramTable` calls, so a
    truncated table and the real one agree element for element instead of being two writings of one
    formula. It is the reference's own order -- fp32 product, then narrow -- because an E8M0 scale

    The routed experts stay in the shards, so what this allocates is the dense half: about 16 GiB in
    bf16 for the released geometry, against the 476 GiB on disk. `resident_engram` adds the two
    Engram tables on top of that -- 189.1 GiB -- and is what a real run wants; see
    `CheckpointEngramTable` for why gathering them from the shards is not an option here.

    The forward that follows is the host-offload correctness path, and it is measured now rather than
    assumed: a generated token costs 15 to 42 s, of which the attention stack is 0.37 s, and the rest
    is the routed experts -- 240 of them per token at the checkpoint's 6 per layer, at 0.122 s each
    on a miss. The cost is the expansion and not the bytes: 0.3% of a miss is reading the mapping and
    99.7% is turning fp4 codes into fp32 and then bf16. `CheckpointRoutedExperts` is that subject,
    and this function's is only the dense half.

    `expert_device` moves the routed experts off the host and onto `expert_world` cards
    (`DeviceRoutedExperts`), which consumes the packed fp4 in the kernel and so never pays the
    expansion this function's paragraph above is about. It is opt-in and it is allowed to fail: an
    unloadable extension, a card that is not there, or a checkpoint whose expert is laid out the
    other way round all land back on `CheckpointRoutedExperts` with one line on `progress`, because a
    slow correct run is worth more than a fast wrong one. The host path is unchanged and is still
    what an unset `expert_device` gives.

    `resident_experts` preloads the checkpoint's routed experts and its two Engram tables into one
    POSIX shared-memory segment before the tree is built, so that neither path above ever reads
    `/mnt/data3` again. `None` means ask `DEEPSEEK_V41_RESIDENT_EXPERTS`, which is what keeps this
    opt-in; see `resident_bank`. Every route the bank takes reads the same bytes it read before -- the
    segment is filled from `reader.entry_view`'s own offsets and the host comparison is element for
    element -- so this is a change of source and not of arithmetic.

    A banked run wants `resident_engram=False`, and the two are complements rather than a conflict:
    the segment holds the tables, `rows` reads them out of it, and the per-process 189.1 GiB copy
    `resident_engram` would make is the thing four ranks must not each pay. The dense tree is
    deliberately not in the segment: those keys are not routed experts or tables, `packed` leaves them
    on the mapping, and a second resident form of 16.79 GiB would cost the RAM twice.

    `expert_hot_rows` gives each card a resident set of its own dealt experts and refills it once a
    layer, so a prefill stages what a row asks for beyond the set rather than every draw. It is a
    capacity, but the rule that fills it is not one: an expert is resident iff the layer asks this
    card for it at least twice, which is what the sweep in
    `docs/performance/deepseek_v4_1_flash_device_experts.md` measured to be worth 3.04x fewer packed
    rows staged at 128 tokens and 6.54x at 512, four ranks summed. It needs `expert_device`, because
    there is no arena to keep anything in otherwise, and it needs one arena a card rather than one a
    layer: 64 slots a card of page-locked memory is 1.2 GiB, and forty layers each holding their own
    is 47 GiB of a 22 GiB card. Both the arena and the pinned block it fills through are sized by
    this number, so the memory is spent at startup and not as the layers get to it. Zero -- the
    default -- is the configuration every number above it was measured on.

    `expert_pool_rows` is the other half of that idea: it sizes a pool of arena rows a card keeps
    experts in, handing out a row on an expert's first sight and taking it back least-recently-used
    when the pool runs out. A pool row is filled on demand and keeps its bytes until the pool gives
    the row to somebody else, where a fill row is chosen up front for the whole layer and rewritten
    by the next layer's fill -- so the pool pays only for the rows a layer actually draws and never
    for the ones it does not, and it pays them as they are drawn rather than in one block before the
    layer starts.

    **The key is `(layer, expert)` and it has to be**, because an expert id is not an identity: the
    weights are `layers.{layer}.ffn.experts.{expert}.*`, so layer 6's expert 7 is a different tensor
    from layer 5's. The first version of this keyed on the id alone and answered a layer 6 draw with
    layer 5's bytes; it is measured in
    `docs/performance/deepseek_v4_1_flash_device_experts.md`, and the short of it is that every
    pooled run moved the top 32 logits by 4.7-6.8 of a max of 29.15 while agreeing with the other run
    at the same width to the digit. So the pool holds a layer's working set and not the model's:
    nothing is carried across a layer boundary, and a decode step -- one row a layer, one draw an
    expert -- is the case it cannot help at all, which is the same reason `expert_hot_rows` cannot.
    Leave `expert_hot_rows` at zero with it; both can be set and the resident set is then consulted
    first, but the two are alternatives and the sweep above is the one that prices them against each
    other.

    `world`/`rank` cut the dense tree across cards. Every module is built a `1/world` wide slice of
    itself -- 16 of the 64 heads, 2 of the 8 o-groups, a quarter of the shared expert's intermediate
    -- and `checkpoint_weights` cuts the file's tensors to match; see `tp.py` for which boundaries are
    cut and, more importantly, the two that are not. `world=1` builds the whole tree and fills it
    unsharded, which is the same code path with every division by one.

    One cost worth naming, because it is paid in every configuration and is not small: the fill reads
    each of those tensors *whole* and then slices, because a shard mapping has no way to hand back a
    row band. At TP4 that is 4 x 16.79 GiB of reads to fill 16.79 GiB of parameters. Against the
    resident bank it is a memcpy; against `/mnt/data3` at 213 MiB/s it is about 5 extra minutes of
    startup, and `expert_rank` already exists to make the four ranks stagger rather than collide.
