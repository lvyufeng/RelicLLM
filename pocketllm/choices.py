"""One request, several choices: the fan-out both front ends share.

``n`` is an OpenAI request field and the engine underneath has no notion of it. What an engine
schedules is one generation, so ``n`` choices are ``n`` generations, and the request field is
therefore a *dispatch* rule rather than a model rule. That is why the fan-out lives here and not in
an adapter: implemented per backend it would be the rule written once per runtime, and it is not the
runtime's rule to own -- the two backends that exist would answer it the same way, and the third
would have to be told.

Both hosts call in from here: ``pocketllm/server/openai.py`` for HTTP and ``pocketllm/engine.py``
for the library surface. One implementation, so ``LLM.chat(n=3)`` and an HTTP ``"n": 3`` cannot
disagree about how many generations that is.

Three rules, and all three are ported from the C++ front end that served ``n`` before this module
did:

* **A choice is its own request.** Each is admitted, scheduled and sampled on its own, which is what
  makes a cancellation or a deadline land per choice rather than per group.
* **Choice 0 keeps the caller's seed; the rest derive from it.** Varying the seed is what makes the
  choices different answers instead of one answer repeated, and it only means anything once sampling
  is stochastic -- under greedy decoding the seed is never read, so every choice is given the same
  value and the answer is the greedy text ``n`` times, which is what a greedy request for ``n``
  choices asks for.
* **Usage is OpenAI's**, not the engine's: the prompt is counted once for the request and
  ``completion_tokens`` is the sum over the choices. See :func:`folded_usage`.

The request id of a choice is its parent's with :data:`CHOICE_MARK` and the index appended, and
that shape is load-bearing rather than cosmetic: it is how ``BackendBase.cancel`` reaches every
choice of a request from the one id the client was handed (see :data:`CHOICE_MARK`).
