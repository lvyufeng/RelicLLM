"""Present a Python model runtime to the C++ scheduler as an engine.

`BatchScheduler` is one library with as many hosts as there are engines. `cpp` is a host because a
native engine implements `pocket::InferenceEngine` in C++, and `QwenBatchScheduler` takes that
interface rather than the one concrete engine that happened to exist first. This module is what
lets the Python runtimes be hosts too: it implements the same interface *in Python*, so `v41`,
`mimo` and `xing4` reach the same scheduler -- the same admission, the same slot lifecycle, the
same cancellation, the same per-request timings and the same gauges -- instead of each adapter
running its own request loop beside one.

Two things make that possible, and the file is mostly about them.

**A whole-generation loop, advanced a token at a time.** The runtimes in this repository generate
by running to the end: `src/models/<model>/generate.py` takes a prompt and a budget, hands each
token to an `on_token` callback, and asks an `on_step` callback before every decode step whether to
keep going. The scheduler wants the other shape -- one token per call, so it can interleave, admit
and cancel between tokens. [`RuntimeRun`] reconciles the two by running the loop on its own thread
and meeting it at the callbacks it already has: `on_step` is where it waits for permission to take
the next step and `on_token` is where the token comes back. No model code changes, and the seam is
one the runtime was already using to observe cancellation.

**Width 1, declared rather than assumed.** Every runtime here currently advances one request at a
time, so each declares `continuous_batching=False` and `max_slots=1` -- the declaration the
scheduler reads to decide how many rows it may hand over. That is not a placeholder: the scheduler
takes the smaller of the requested width and the declaration, so an honest `False` is what makes
it correct to drive such an engine at all. Raising a runtime's width is a later change, and it
happens by changing its declaration, not by changing the scheduler.

The cost of the handshake is one thread and one semaphore per in-flight request, which at width 1
is one of each. The step itself is a `Semaphore.release` and a queue read; against a decode step
that is tens of milliseconds of device work, that is not measurable.
