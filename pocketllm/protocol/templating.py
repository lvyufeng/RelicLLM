"""Which chat template an architecture uses, and how its answer reads back.

A checkpoint declares a ``model_type`` and that selects a templater.  DeepSeek-V4 has its own
encoder in :mod:`src.encoding.deepseek_v4`, which renders DSML tool-call syntax and the reasoning
controls; every other architecture goes through the checkpoint's own Hugging Face chat template,
which is what lets a runtime serve a model this repository has no bespoke encoder for.

That selection was written for the C++ front end's sidecar, where the C++ engine had no Python
templating of its own, and it was the *only* place in the tree where a generated text was read back
into ``content`` / ``reasoning_content`` / ``tool_calls``.  The Python host had no counterpart, so a
request served through ``pocketllm serve --backend cpp`` came back as one undifferentiated
``content`` string while the same checkpoint served by the C++ front end came back split.  It lives
here, in the shared protocol plane, so both hosts reach one implementation -- and so that deleting
the C++ front end is not the same thing as deleting the reading.

The classes carry both directions because the two hosts want different halves: the sidecar needs
``encode`` (it is the only templating the C++ engine has), while the Python host already encodes
through :func:`pocketllm.protocol.encode_chat_prompt` and reads only the answer back -- by ``parse``
when a generation is finished, and by ``split_reasoning`` while one is still arriving.
